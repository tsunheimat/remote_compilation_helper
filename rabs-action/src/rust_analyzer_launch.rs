//! rust-analyzer canonical Cargo-launch integration + fallback
//! (bead K017; plan Epic K/m10).
//!
//! rust-analyzer (RA) is the highest-frequency Cargo driver on a
//! developer box: every keystroke-save fires `cargo check` shaped
//! requests whose low-latency `.rmeta`/check hits are among the most
//! user-visible serving wins. But an IDE process is also the LEAST
//! trustworthy driver in the fleet: its cwd may be any checkout, its
//! env is whatever the editor session inherited, and nobody audited it.
//!
//! The law this module enforces:
//!
//! - **Shared workspace authority requires supported configuration.**
//!   RA's Cargo enters the canonical driver namespace only when the
//!   caller observed the supported wrapper configuration (canonical
//!   wrapper declared, no rogue target-dir override, provenance
//!   contract resolved). Then IDE-triggered checks flow through the
//!   SAME wrappers and cache as explicit agent commands — one key
//!   space, no IDE-special keys.
//! - **A noncanonical RA parent gets the reduced lane.** Outside the
//!   canonical namespace, RA keeps real value — admitted
//!   dependency-compilation acceleration and local execution — but
//!   never shared-workspace authority: no speculative serving against
//!   a workspace it cannot spell canonically, no publication rights.
//! - **Metrics distinguish IDE-triggered from explicit commands** so
//!   operators can see which serving wins come from whom without
//!   either lane contaminating the other's accounting.
//!
//! Pure policy over observed facts; the caller supplies RA's resolved
//! cwd/config state exactly as observed (same posture as K015/K019:
//! classification over observations, resolution elsewhere).
//!
//! # Dependency rules
//!
//! Same as the crate: depends on rabs-protocol only; pure functions.
