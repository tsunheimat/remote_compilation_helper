//! Default-deny network namespace policy (beads E002/E025; plan §186 and
//! §82.1; couples to S003's capability tokens).
//!
//! The D003 launcher already compiles network default-deny into the
//! canonical namespace argv (`--unshare-net` whenever the spec does not
//! explicitly allow the network; see [`crate::canonical_namespace`]). This
//! module completes E002 around that enforcement:
//!
//! - **The gate.** A fetch may reach the network only through an explicit,
//!   currently-valid `CapabilityKind::OpenNetwork` token minted for exactly
//!   this session/operation ([`evaluate_open_network`]; zero or several
//!   valid grants refuse — one grant is least privilege). The grant is
//!   opaque outside this module and its redaction-safe scope MUST equal the
//!   digest of an exact [`BoundedNetworkPolicy`].
//! - **The enforcement.** [`prepare_brokered_fetch`] asks a trusted EDGE
//!   adapter to install the exact authority, redirect, request, and byte
//!   bounds over a controlled inherited-FD or Unix-socket channel. Cargo is
//!   not running in this phase; its later namespace RETAINS `--unshare-net`
//!   and never receives the channel. DNS and remote sockets remain
//!   broker-owned. [`finish_brokered_fetch`] consumes the one-shot lease,
//!   revalidates capability authority, checks the broker's observations,
//!   and only then issues an opaque receipt. Failure leaves the spec closed.
//!   `allow_network` is private to the namespace module and ordinary mount plans are always
//!   closed, so there is no public ambient-open bypass.
//!   Per-action build views stay closed unconditionally (plan §36: fetching
//!   is its own action; the build action never sees the wire).
//! - **The record.** Every constructed launch derives its
//!   [`IsolationEvidenceRecord`] from what the argv ACTUALLY enforces
//!   ([`boundary_isolation_evidence`]) — enforcement facts per control,
//!   never aspiration (E010's schema).
//! - **The observation.** A network attempt inside a default-deny hermetic
//!   action is recorded as the observation fact it is
//!   ([`denied_attempt_observation`]) and classifies
//!   [`rabs_protocol::volatility::EffectClass::NetworkSensitive`] — never `Hermetic`.
//!
//! Attempt DETECTION (the syscall tracer that notices an attempted
//! connect) is E005/E009 scope; this module fixes the shape of the fact
//! those observers will produce and proves the denial end to end in
//! `tests/network_namespace_linux.rs`.
