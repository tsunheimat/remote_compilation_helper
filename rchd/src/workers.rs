// `rch-wkr capabilities` shells out to rustc/node/npm/go/zig/cargo-zigbuild and
// stats the disk, behind a fresh SSH handshake. On an idle box that is ~1s; on a
// busy build host it is far more. Measured across the fleet with builds running
// (10-core workers at load 45-60): 2.9s, 6.3s, 7.2s, 8.6s, **15.8s**. Against the
// former 4s/8s pair every one of those hosts failed its probe.
//
// That failure is self-defeating: a probe that only fails under load means
// `disk_free_gb` goes stale exactly on the workers that are actively filling
// their disks, and `is_low_disk()` returns `None` for missing data — so the
// low-disk admission gate FAILS OPEN and the dispatcher keeps feeding a worker
// that is about to hit ENOSPC.
//
// This is a low-frequency operator query (`rch workers capabilities --refresh`),
// not one of the ~30s poll loops, and refreshes run concurrently across workers,
// so a generous ceiling costs nothing in the common case and only ever shortens
// the tail.

// =============================================================================
// Worker lifecycle type model (bd-session-history-remediation-ocv9i.1.1)
// =============================================================================
//
// A worker's lifecycle is modelled as **two independent axes** so that
// permanent operator intent can never be confused with transient scheduler
// eligibility:
//
//   1. [`AdminIntent`]  — the *desired inventory* axis. Changes ONLY through
//      explicit operator actions (`rch workers disable/enable/drain`). This is
//      what `workers.toml` encodes; it is the source of truth for what the
//      operator wants in the fleet.
//   2. [`EligibilityState`] — the *live scheduler eligibility* axis. Advances
//      automatically from health probes and concrete failure classes. It NEVER
//      writes back to `AdminIntent` / `workers.toml`.
//
// The cardinal safety invariant (session-history remediation): a transient
// failure quarantines a worker on the eligibility axis (`TemporaryBypass`) but
// must never mutate desired inventory, and a recovering worker must never
// auto-rejoin if the operator has disabled it. Keeping the two axes as distinct
// types makes "auto-rejoin an operator-disabled worker" unrepresentable rather
// than merely discouraged.
//
// ## Serialization compatibility policy
//
// These types derive `serde` with `snake_case` so they are stable across the
// daemon/status JSON boundary. They are *additive*: the legacy single-axis
// [`WorkerStatus`] enum is untouched, and [`WorkerLifecycle::legacy_status`]
// collapses the two axes back to a `WorkerStatus` for older status consumers
// (both quarantine states — `TemporaryBypass` and `RecoveredPendingCanary` —
// collapse to `Unreachable` so they stay out of legacy scheduling).
// New variants must be appended, never reordered or renamed, so historical
// JSONL replays continue to deserialize.
