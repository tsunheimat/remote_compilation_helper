# Configuration Guide

This guide consolidates how RCH configuration works, where files live, and how
values are resolved when multiple layers exist.

## Overview

RCH has three primary configuration surfaces:

1. **Hook/CLI config** (`config.toml`) for interception, transfer, and circuit
   breaker behavior.
2. **Worker definitions** (`workers.toml`) for daemon-managed worker inventory.
3. **Daemon settings** (`daemon.toml`) for health checks and socket behavior.

## Precedence (Hook/CLI Config)

For `rch` (the hook/CLI), the effective configuration is resolved in this order
(lowest to highest):

1. Built-in defaults
2. User config: `~/.config/rch/config.toml`
3. Project config: `.rch/config.toml`
4. Environment variables (RCH_*)
5. Command-line flags (when a command supports them)

Tip: use `rch config show --sources` to see where each value came from.

Note: the config library includes support for `.env` / `.rch.env` files and
profile presets (via `RCH_PROFILE`), but the current `rch` loader only applies
user/project config + env overrides. Verify your effective values with
`rch config show --sources`.

## Hook/CLI Config File (`config.toml`)

Location:
- User: `~/.config/rch/config.toml`
- Project: `.rch/config.toml`

Sections and fields:

### Worker cache, scratch and environment placement

Set these once in the controller's `~/.config/rch/config.toml`; project config
may override individual keys. They apply to the remote execution path used by
`rch exec`, `rch exec --job` and the hook. They do not configure standalone
`rch-wkr execute`, canary self-tests, source transfer staging or the RABS sidecar.

```toml
[execution.storage]
root = "/srv/rch"                 # worker path, preferably on the worker SSD
# cache_root = "/srv/rch/cache"  # overrides root/cache
# tmp_root = "/srv/rch/tmp/jobs" # overrides root/tmp/jobs
# home_root = "/srv/rch/home"    # optional; HOME otherwise stays unchanged
tmp_mode = "env"                 # or "private_mount" on Linux
tmp_retention_hours = 24         # abandoned-job sweep; 0 disables it

[environment.remote]
GOPROXY = "https://nexus.example/repository/go-proxy/"
NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY = "https://nexus.example/repository/npm-group/"
PIP_INDEX_URL = "https://nexus.example/repository/pypi-group/simple"

[remediation.pooled_target]
store_base = "/srv/rch/targets"  # existing Cargo target-pool configuration
```

With all storage paths unset, native placements remain unchanged. `cache_root` and
`tmp_root` can also be used independently. Paths are absolute POSIX worker
paths; no controller-side tilde, variable or shell expansion is performed.
Configured storage is refused on Windows workers. For a mixed fleet, scope
this configuration to projects routed to POSIX workers.

| Variable | Under the configured cache root |
|---|---|
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | `xdg` |
| `CARGO_HOME` | `cargo-home` |
| `GOCACHE`, `GOMODCACHE`, `GOPATH` | `go-build`, `go-mod`, `go-path` |
| `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE`, `BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR` | `npm`, `bun` |
| `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `PIP_CACHE_DIR` | `uv`, `pip` |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` | `playwright` |

Package caches persist across jobs. Cargo target keys, target-pool reuse and
artifact retrieval still use RCH's native target policy. A new `CARGO_HOME`
does not copy the old registry credentials/configuration: provision the new
directory if those are required. Changing `HOME` is opt-in because it affects
tool discovery and credentials; explicitly set worker `RUSTUP_HOME` in
`environment.remote` if rustup toolchains remain under the original home.

Remote environment values are literal defaults. Allowlisted controller values
override those defaults; RCH-managed cache/tmp/target paths override both.
Explicit assignments *inside the authored command* retain normal shell
semantics. This is placement policy, not a security sandbox for arbitrary code.
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `RCH_CH_BASE` and the recursion-bypass variable cannot be
set through `environment.remote`. Profile values may contain credentials, so
`config show/get` reports their names and `(set)` rather than their values.
Use worker-side credential provisioning instead of committing secrets.

Managed tmp creates a unique `rch-job-<UUID>/tmp` outside the source mirror,
exports `TMPDIR`, `TMP` and `TEMP`, and inherits a lease into the existing RCH
watchdog/process group. The worker needs `flock` and `find`. Cleanup after
success or failure only removes that job directory after its lease is free;
descendants retaining the inherited lease keep it. A killed supervisor or
interrupted connection may leave the directory for the next age-and-lock
sweep. The sweep never kills processes or infers a build's completion. Recovery receipts and result
directories remain in their original locations.

`private_mount` additionally uses `unshare --mount --propagation private` and
binds the job scratch directory over `/tmp`. It requires Linux mount namespace
privileges and the `unshare`/`mount` tools. Missing privileges fail before the
workload runs; there is no silent downgrade or sudo invocation. Storage paths,
source mirrors, target pools and worker tools must resolve outside `/tmp`,
since the private mount hides its original contents. Namespace setup leaves
process/session identity to RCH's existing watchdog, so cancellation still
targets the same process group.
`env` mode does not redirect programs that hardcode `/tmp`.

Source mirrors, cache-warm staging and controller storage retain their existing
configuration. Package caches are not swept by the job-tmp cleaner. Existing
disk-pressure telemetry must still observe the volume you use: place the
worker canonical mirror and these paths on that monitored volume, and use
the tool's own cache cleanup for persistent package caches. This setting
does not install a filesystem, impose a quota or guarantee that `/srv/rch`
is disk-backed.

Inspect or change individual keys with, for example:

```bash
rch config set execution.storage.root /srv/rch
rch config set environment.remote.GOPROXY https://nexus.example/repository/go-proxy/
rch config get execution.storage.root --sources
rch config validate
```

### `[general]`
- `enabled` (bool, default `true`) — Master on/off switch for the hook.
- `log_level` (string, default `"info"`) — `trace|debug|info|warn|error`.
- `socket_path` (string, default `"$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rch.sock"` if set, otherwise
  `"~/.cache/rch/rch.sock"`; falls back to `"/tmp/rch.sock"`) — Unix socket path
  used to communicate with the daemon.

### `[compilation]`
- `confidence_threshold` (float, default `0.85`) — Minimum classifier confidence
  to intercept a command.
- `min_local_time_ms` (u64, default `2000`) — Skip interception if the estimated
  local runtime is shorter than this. Uses timing history from past builds.
- `remote_speedup_threshold` (float, default `1.2`) — Minimum predicted speedup
  ratio (local/remote) required for offloading. Set to `1.0` to always offload
  when other criteria are met. Set higher (e.g., `1.5`) to only offload builds
  predicted to be significantly faster remotely.

### `[transfer]`
- `compression_level` (u32, default `3`) — zstd compression level.
- `exclude_patterns` (list) — Patterns excluded from transfer. Defaults include:
  `target/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, common build caches, and
  coverage output. Use `rch config show` to see the full effective list.
- `ssh_server_alive_interval_secs` (u64, optional) — Sets `ssh -o ServerAliveInterval`
  for remote execution and rsync transfers to reduce dropped connections on flaky networks.
- `ssh_control_persist_secs` (u64, optional) — Sets `ssh -o ControlPersist=<N>s` for
  remote execution (ControlMaster). Use `0` to disable persistence (`ControlPersist=no`).
- `sync_timeout_ms` (u64, optional; `1000..=3600000`) — Per-attempt timeout for
  uploading source to the worker. When unset, RCH uses a payload-aware default:
  30 seconds plus one second per MiB at a conservative 1 MiB/s floor, capped at
  one hour. Each retry receives this full timeout and resumes the same partial
  immutable-base upload. This setting does not affect remote Cargo execution or
  artifact-return timeouts.
- `source_sync_silence_timeout_secs` (u64, default `120`) — Abort a source sync
  after this many seconds with no rsync output at all (no progress refresh,
  stats, or itemized line). This detects a dead channel or wedged rsync far
  faster than the wall-clock `sync_timeout_ms` cap, while a large but
  progressing transfer is never affected: every `--info=progress2` refresh
  counts as forward progress. On a stall, the hook releases the worker's
  reservation and retries the build on another admissible worker. `0` disables
  silence detection.
- `rsync_bin` (string, optional) — Explicit rsync binary for every local
  transfer. Unset (the default) lets RCH resolve one: the `PATH` rsync when it
  is rsync 3.1 or newer, otherwise a modern rsync from
  `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, or `/opt/local/bin`, otherwise the
  `PATH` binary driven with an openrsync/rsync 2.6.9-compatible flag set (no
  `--info=*`, zlib instead of zstd, no `--append-verify`; the zero-build-output
  detector fails open). `~` is expanded and a bare name is looked up on `PATH`.
  The `RCH_RSYNC_BIN` environment variable overrides this setting. `rch doctor`
  shows the resolved binary and flavour.

### `[circuit]`
- `failure_threshold` (u32, default `3`) — Consecutive failures to open.
- `success_threshold` (u32, default `2`) — Consecutive successes to close.
- `error_rate_threshold` (float, default `0.5`) — Error rate to open in window.
- `window_secs` (u64, default `60`) — Rolling error window size.
- `open_cooldown_secs` (u64, default `30`) — Cooldown before half-open.
- `half_open_max_probes` (u32, default `1`) — Concurrent probes allowed.

Example:

```toml
[general]
enabled = true
log_level = "info"
socket_path = "~/.cache/rch/rch.sock"

[compilation]
confidence_threshold = 0.85
min_local_time_ms = 2000
remote_speedup_threshold = 1.2

[transfer]
compression_level = 3
exclude_patterns = ["target/", "node_modules/"]
ssh_server_alive_interval_secs = 30
ssh_control_persist_secs = 60

[circuit]
failure_threshold = 3
success_threshold = 2
error_rate_threshold = 0.5
window_secs = 60
open_cooldown_secs = 30
half_open_max_probes = 1
```

### `[path_topology]`
- `canonical_root` (string, optional, default `"/data/projects"`) — Canonical
  project root directory. Override this on systems where `/data/projects` is
  unavailable (e.g., macOS with SIP).
- `alias_root` (string, optional, default `"/dp"`) — Symlink alias root that
  points at the canonical root.

Environment variable overrides:
- `RCH_CANONICAL_PROJECT_ROOT`
- `RCH_ALIAS_PROJECT_ROOT`

Example (macOS):

```toml
[path_topology]
canonical_root = "/Users/me/Projects"
alias_root = "/Users/me/p"
```

### `[api]` — daemon status API over the tailnet

`rchd`'s rich state (`/status`, `/workers/capabilities`) lives on a `0600` Unix
socket that only the local user can read. This section serves the same JSON on
a TCP listener so agents and the fleet dashboard on *other* machines can ask a
dispatcher "why are you local-only right now?" without ssh. It is designed for
a Tailscale tailnet and is **off** unless `bind` is set.

- `bind` (string, default `""` = off) — `"tailscale"` resolves this machine's
  Tailscale IPv4 at daemon start (port 9101); `"tailscale:PORT"`, `"IP:PORT"`
  or `"[v6]:PORT"` are taken literally. The address must be loopback or inside
  Tailscale's ranges (`100.64.0.0/10`, `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`); anything else is
  refused at startup — the payload carries worker hosts and IPs.
- `token` (string, optional) — bearer token required on `/status`,
  `/workers/capabilities`, `/workers/config`,
  `/repo-convergence/status[?worker=<id>]`. Sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-Rch-Token: <token>`.
- `token_file` (string, optional) — file holding the token (trimmed, `~`
  expanded). Wins over `token`. Keep it `0600`.
- `no_token` (bool, default `false`) — serve the status routes with no token.
  Honoured only when no token is configured and must be set explicitly, so an
  empty token is never an accidental open door.
- `allow_any_addr` (bool, default `false`) — permit a bind outside loopback and
  the Tailscale ranges. You almost never want this.

`/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics` and `/budget` are served on the same listener
without a token, exactly as on loopback `:9100`. A bad `[api]` section is
logged with its fix and the daemon keeps running without the API — a dashboard
knob must never stop builds. CLI overrides: `rchd --api-bind`,
`rchd --api-token-file`. Set from the CLI:

```bash
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=' > ~/.config/rch/api.token
chmod 600 ~/.config/rch/api.token
rch config set api.bind tailscale
rch config set api.token_file ~/.config/rch/api.token
# then restart rchd; verify from another tailnet box:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.config/rch/api.token)" http://100.x.y.z:9101/status | jq .daemon
```

### `[dashboard]`
- `url` (string, optional) — where the fleet dashboard is served, e.g.
  `https://rch-fleet.vercel.app`. `rch web` opens it (`--url` and
  `RCH_DASHBOARD_URL` override). Agents use `<url>/api/fleet?view=help`.

## Workers Config (`workers.toml`)

Location: `~/.config/rch/workers.toml`

Each worker entry:
- `id` (string, required) — Unique identifier.
- `host` (string, required) — Hostname or IP.
- `user` (string, default `"ubuntu"`) — SSH user.
- `identity_file` (string, default `"~/.ssh/id_rsa"`) — SSH key path.
- `total_slots` (u32, default `8`) — CPU slots available.
- `priority` (u32, default `100`) — Higher = preferred.
- `tags` (list, default `[]`) — Optional selection tags.
- `tools` (list, default `[]`) — Verified named tool probes; see below.
- `enabled` (bool, default `true`) — Skip worker if false.

Example:

```toml
[[workers]]
id = "worker-1"
host = "203.0.113.20"
user = "ubuntu"
identity_file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
total_slots = 16
priority = 100
tags = ["ssd", "fast"]
enabled = true
tools = [
  { name = "clang",  command = ["clang", "--version"] },
  { name = "ld.lld", command = ["/usr/bin/ld.lld", "--version"] },
]
```

### `tools` — verified named tool probes

Each entry declares a **fixed argv** that the worker runs as its configured
user. The probe is judged by **exit status alone** — zero means present,
anything else (missing binary, error exit, signal) means absent — and its
output is discarded so a chatty tool cannot corrupt the fact stream.

- `name` (string, required) — ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.` or `+`.
  Anything else (a space, an `=`, a control character) is **refused when the
  config loads**: such a name could not survive the probe's `RCH_FACT
  tool=<name>` format and would be read back as a different name, which is a
  silent capability lie rather than a loud config error.
- `command` (list of strings, required, non-empty) — the exact argv. It is
  never caller-supplied; RCH exposes no general remote-shell probe API,
  because a caller that could ask a worker to run an arbitrary command "to
  check for a tool" would be a remote execution primitive wearing a
  capability-probe hat.

Results appear in `rch workers capabilities --refresh` under **Named tools**,
split into `verified:` and `failed:`. The split matters: a worker that
declared a tool whose probe fails is broken, while a name nothing declared is
usually a typo or a fleet that was never configured for it.

Declaring no `tools` sends the worker the byte-identical capability command it
has always received, so adding probes to one worker cannot disturb the rest of
a fleet — including workers still running an older `rch-wkr`.

Jobs require them with `rch exec --job --require-tool NAME`, or per project:

```toml
# .rch/config.toml or ~/.config/rch/config.toml
[jobs]
required_tools = ["clang"]
```

Project defaults add to `--require-tool` rather than replacing it, and both
apply to **job mode only**. A required tool no worker has verified admits no
worker at all; selection reports
`capability_missing:tool:<name>:probe_failed` or `...:not_declared`.

## Daemon Config (`daemon.toml`)

Location: `~/.config/rch/daemon.toml`

Fields:
- `socket_path` (default `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rch.sock` or `~/.cache/rch/rch.sock`)
  — Unix socket path.
- `health_check_interval_secs` (default `30`) — Health check cadence.
- `worker_timeout_secs` (default `10`) — Mark worker unreachable after timeout.
- `max_jobs_per_slot` (default `1`) — Max concurrent jobs per slot.
- `connection_pooling` (default `true`) — Reuse SSH connections.
- `log_level` (default `"info"`) — Daemon logging level.

## Environment Variables (RCH_*)

RCH uses environment variables for overrides, tooling, and testing. The list
below groups variables by intent. If you are unsure whether a variable is
applied in your version, verify with `rch config show --sources` or `rch --help`.

### Core runtime overrides (hook/CLI)
These are read by the hook configuration loader:

- `RCH_ENABLED`
- `RCH_LOG_LEVEL`
- `RCH_SOCKET_PATH`
- `RCH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`
- `RCH_MIN_LOCAL_TIME_MS`
- `RCH_REMOTE_SPEEDUP_THRESHOLD`
- `RCH_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`
- `RCH_COMPRESSION` (legacy alias for `RCH_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`)
- `RCH_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` (per-attempt source-upload timeout; `1000..=3600000`)
- `RCH_CANONICAL_PROJECT_ROOT`
- `RCH_ALIAS_PROJECT_ROOT`

`rch config export` emits the loader-consumed names above so exported shell or
`.env` output can be sourced directly. Use `rch config show --sources` to verify
which layer supplied each value.

### CLI/daemon options (documented in `rch --help` / validators)

- `RCH_PROFILE`
- `RCH_LOG_FORMAT`
- `RCH_DAEMON_SOCKET` (legacy alias for `RCH_SOCKET_PATH`; the canonical name wins when both are set)
- `RCH_DAEMON_TIMEOUT_MS` (daemon socket connect/read timeout in milliseconds, `100..=600000`, default `5000`; the select-worker wait keeps `RCH_DAEMON_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_SECS` / `RCH_DAEMON_WAIT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_SECS`)
- `RCH_TRANSFER_ZSTD_LEVEL` (legacy alias for `RCH_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`, lowest precedence)
- `RCH_ENABLE_METRICS`
- `RCH_TEST_MODE`
- `RCH_WORKER` (preferred worker override)
- `RCH_WORKERS` (comma-separated preferred worker override list)

SSH identities are per worker (`identity_file` in `workers.toml`); there is no
global `RCH_SSH_KEY` override.

- `RCH_LAST_BUILD_WORKER`
- `RCH_BUILD_SUCCESS`
- `RCH_BUILD_ERROR`
- `RCH_AVAILABLE_WORKERS`
- `RCH_TEST_HOOK`

### Fleet dashboard

- `RCH_E2E_VERBOSE`
- `RCH_E2E_WORKERS_FILE`
- `RCH_E2E_WORKER_HOST`

- `RCH_BYPASS`
- `RCH_DRY_RUN`
- `RCH_LOCAL_ONLY`
- `RCH_STREAM_MODE`
- `RCH_NO_CACHE`

## Per-Project Configuration

Use `.rch/config.toml` when you need project-specific behavior (e.g. disable
RCH for a repo or change thresholds). Only the sections above are recognized;
unknown keys are ignored.

## Debugging Configuration
