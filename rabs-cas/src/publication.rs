//! Prepared-result offer + coordinator-only atomic publication (bead
//! H011; plan §62/§66; invariants I8/I9/I10; risk R50).
//!
//! The worker side ends at [`OfferPreparedActionResult::build`]: a worker
//! harvests its private write set, validates outputs against declarations,
//! uploads objects under candidate pins, and OFFERS. There is deliberately
//! no worker-reachable commit API — a worker never sends a command asking
//! another component to commit on its behalf; the type system enforces it
//! (only [`process_offer`] touches the store).
//!
//! The coordinator side is an ordered admission pipeline over the H009
//! metadata store:
//!
//! 1. authority fence: the offer's full coordinator authority must digest
//!    to the ACTIVE authority, and the generation's
//!    `created_under_authority_digest` must equal that digest (the F033
//!    equality check — one full authority copy, bound by digest);
//! 2. generation fence: the generation exists and is not tombstoned;
//! 3. attempt/lease/worker fences: the exact normalized lease-to-attempt
//!    binding, renewal sequence, boot generation, process incarnation, and
//!    current non-ambiguous worker fence all agree;
//! 4. descriptor reload + byte-compare against the coordinator's own copy;
//! 5. key + epoch validation against the action entry;
//! 6. INDEPENDENT digest recompute: the coordinator recomputes
//!    `semantic_result_digest` and `observable_result_digest` from the
//!    versioned projections and refuses on any declared-digest mismatch;
//! 7. complete object closure: every referenced object must already have
//!    a recorded location;
//! 8. same-key candidates classify through the A018 divergence taxonomy:
//!    idempotent re-offers append evidence; semantic and projection-
//!    completeness divergence quarantine the ACTION, while observable-
//!    only divergence applies the narrower presentation quarantine. Every
//!    divergence preserves the committed row (no in-place patching);
//! 9. commit: publication pointer, serving state, winner evidence row,
//!    AND the durable reachability pin in ONE store transaction (H009's
//!    `commit_publication`); the receipt is emitted only after the store
//!    reports durable success.
//!
//! The crash matrix over this protocol is bead H015.
