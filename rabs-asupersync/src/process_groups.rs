//! Managed process groups under attempt ownership (bead G006; plan §189).
//!
//! Every external action runs as the **leader of its own POSIX process
//! group**: the spawn pins `process_group(0)` so the leader becomes a
//! group whose pgid equals the leader pid, and every descendant the
//! action forks joins that group automatically (inherited pgid). This is
//! what makes cancellation and cleanup *complete*: signaling the group
//! reaches build scripts, compilers, and grandchildren that a
//! leader-only kill would orphan.
//!
//! Ownership shape (plan §10.7, invariant I7): the group carries the
//! [`Attribution`] of its owning attempt, so any leaked effect found by
//! the leak scanner attributes along region → coordinator authority →
//! operation → generation → action → attempt exactly like every other
//! runtime resource in this crate.
//!
//! The controlled bounded wait mounts G008's TERM → drain → KILL → reap
//! ordering. The caller owns cancellation/deadline classification; this
//! module returns the real process status and never publishes a result.
//! Supervision/restart budgets remain in G010 (`supervision.rs`).
//!
//! Safety posture: the workspace forbids `unsafe`. Group formation uses
//! the stable `std::os::unix::process::CommandExt::process_group` (no
//! `pre_exec`), and group signaling shells out to `kill(1)` with a
//! negative pid — the standard dependency-free way to reach a whole
//! group from safe Rust.
