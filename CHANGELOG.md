# Changelog

This is a synthesized, agent-facing changelog for the full history of **rch** (Remote
Compilation Helper): the PreToolUse hook + CLI (`rch`), the local daemon (`rchd`), the
worker agent (`rch-wkr`), the RABS build sidecar (`rabs-*`, `rabsd`), and the fleet
dashboard (`dashboard/`).

Scope window: project inception (`v0.1.0`, 2026-01-25) through `v2.1.16` (2026-10-04).

This document was rebuilt from git history (`git log --no-merges` per tag range, `git show`
on representative commits), version tags (`git for-each-ref`), GitHub release metadata
(`gh release list`/`view` — a **release** is a published GitHub Release; **tag only** means
no release was ever published for the tag; one **draft** was never published), and the
checked-in issue tracker (`.beads/issues.jsonl`, queried with `jq`). Where sources
disagreed, git history won. Two tags have no successor number (`v1.0.32`, `v1.0.48` were
never cut) and one orphan tag (`rch-local-superseded-20260710`) lives only on local backup
branches.

This document is intentionally organized by landed capabilities, not raw diff order: each
version has a short narrative, the capabilities it delivered, the tracker workstreams it
closed, and the commits an agent should inspect first. Commit links go to the GitHub commit
page; workstream links go to the tracker file (search it for the id).

Sections for `v1.0.16` and earlier are inherited from the previous changelog and were
re-checked against the tag spine; nine of their commit links (in the `v1.0.16`, `v1.0.2` and
`v1.0.1` sections) point at commits that no longer exist in this repository's rewritten
history. They are kept as-is because the descriptions were verified against the tag ranges,
but those particular links will 404.

## 2.1.16 — 2026-10-04

- **Passing builds are no longer reported as failures when the dispatcher is
  loaded.** The hook allowed only 5s for the daemon to acknowledge a worker
  release. With the operator Mac at load ~110 that window was missed, and the
  hook exited 1 with "daemon release … was not acknowledged" even though the
  command had succeeded and its artifacts had been retrieved (3 of 7 test runs
  on 2026-10-01). Release requests now get at least 30s. Waiting is safe: the
  daemon acknowledges only after processing, and repeating the release of a
  finished build is a no-op. rchd now also logs a "Slow release-worker
  handling" WARN with per-stage milliseconds for any release taking 1s or more
  ([`47fa7192`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/47fa719257fe0936b92dffb45973e8384eff4c2f)).
- **`rch gc` finds and releases abandoned GC claims** (`bd-gyehj`). A GC run
  that dies mid-removal leaves a `fc-*.claim` file behind, and it blocks every
  build of that project tree with "remote retries exhausted". 16 such claims
  were cleaned up by hand on 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-01. `rch gc` now lists
  them (`gc_claims` in JSON). `rch gc --apply` releases one only when it is at
  least 6h old, its record is intact, and no process has a working directory,
  open file or argument inside its tree. A host where that can't be checked
  releases nothing
  ([`6aa3d0aa`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6aa3d0aaafdb8b71c9a8048a44be1d07135c2fa0)).
- **Worker cache sweeps finish on busy workers** (`bd-mz7qk`). The periodic
  stale-target sweep used the 300s default SSH timeout and was cut short every
  cycle on IO-saturated workers, so their cache budget was never enforced.
  Sweeps now get half the reap interval (5–30 min), which is also the main
  way the stranded claims above were being created. They run at idle CPU and
  IO priority
  ([`ade05905`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ade05905302aa4913877d88887aa97708f4f33a2)).
- **`rch cancel <build_id>` explains its ownership refusal.** The refusal now
  names the wrapper that owns the build and the `rch jobs cancel <wrapper>`
  command that works. It also says that an abandoned build is released
  automatically after 15 min of silence if it never started remote work, or
  6h if it did
  ([`36f3e46f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/36f3e46f95750e06cf3df69252befe525be91d7e)).
- A timing-fragile rch-wkr inventory test is now deterministic (`bd-arhz7`)
  ([`7d6f5b8b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/7d6f5b8b8a9d9ce95fd7690ea55bae00b5c5efa2)).

## 2.1.15 — 2026-10-01

- **A request pinned to a worker already running its project waits instead
  of being refused.** Pinning with `RCH_WORKER` already queued when the worker
  was busy, but a worker running the same project was refused on the spot.
  That was the largest remaining refusal class (~190 a day), and one agent
  retried 112 times in 19 minutes. The one-job-per-project-per-worker rule is
  unchanged, and the request never moves to a worker it didn't ask for
  ([`51a7c4af`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/51a7c4afc758820f040fd8b85356f9e2b589056b)).
- **Leases whose remote execution provably died are retired.** When the
  remote supervisor died without writing its completion receipt (reboot, OOM,
  kill), `rch jobs recover` refused forever, and the dead lease kept a worker
  source claim that fenced every overlapping build. Recovery now probes the
  execution's activity lock on the worker. If nothing of the execution is
  alive (or the registry is gone after a reboot), it releases the source claim
  and records a build error, without replaying the command
  ([`ab94bd32`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ab94bd32087d2b6fe2fc32ab6d0afaa6bc2f3c54)).
- **One durable wrapper can own only one live execution.** A second admission
  for the same wrapper id is rejected even on another worker or project,
  atomically under the history lock, so a lost-selection retry cannot run the
  same build twice
  ([`b0feda9d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b0feda9db456fad965f45b2f6d91fead4b9de5da)).
- **An unacknowledged worker release fails closed.** When the daemon's reply
  to a release is lost, the observed exit code is kept, the lease is marked
  release-unconfirmed, and a typed error stops failover or local fallback from
  replaying the command
  ([`559f387b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/559f387b8fc406ce64afcca96fca79d3279443d4)).

## 2.1.14 — 2026-09-30

- **A bad ownership snapshot no longer crash-loops the daemon** (`bd-tqmak`).
  Since 2.1.13, rchd rejects a contradictory durable ownership snapshot, and it
  already rejected malformed or truncated ones. Either stopped startup, and
  under systemd or launchd that became a restart loop that refused every build
  on the dispatcher. The snapshot is now renamed to
  `*.ownership.json.rejected-<unix-seconds>` byte-for-byte, and an ERROR names
  the reason and the builds it recorded as active (`id@worker[wrapper]`) so they
  can be recovered or cancelled from their clients. rchd then starts without
  it. Worker-side source claims still fence those builds' sources. Other I/O
  errors still stop startup
  ([`e78d5613`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e78d5613953629b5093b51eaa9944bde87936cd6)).

## 2.1.13 — 2026-09-29

- **A build whose wrapper died before remote exec releases its slots after
  15 minutes, not 6 hours** (`bd-axhoi`). A wrapper killed during source sync
  left a build holding 4 slots on vmi1152480 for 4.6 hours. Nothing could be
  running remotely for it, but it waited out the 6-hour bound meant for remote
  lifetime caps. Builds whose remote command started keep the long bound, and
  a lease that still owns worker source still goes to lease recovery. Also
  fixes wrapper identity on macOS dispatchers. The identity check expected the
  Linux form and split a macOS identity inside its start time, so every Mac
  wrapper read as unverified, and a dead one whose pid was reused kept its
  slots forever
  ([`e872ab6a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e872ab6a2341a0d595debbad7fd3d42748bac058)).
- **`rch fleet deploy` skips workers that are already current, and
  `rch fleet status` shows real versions.** Both read the worker's version as
  the last token of `rch-wkr 2.1.12 (commit …)`, i.e. the commit hash. Status
  printed `(bbe0aa61f20c))`, and deploy's "already at version" check never
  matched, so every deploy restarted every worker
  ([`ec44266d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ec44266d21bd164029b8e5b3bec6d8245c492d46)).
- **Contradictory recovered ownership is rejected instead of guessed**
  (`bd-w2qrp`). Loading the durable ownership snapshot now rejects duplicate
  active wrapper ids across workers or projects, empty wrapper ids, wrappers
  that are both active and cancelled, and terminal ids outside the active
  namespace. Legitimate sequential failover and anonymous owners are kept.
  Caveat: a rejected snapshot currently stops rchd from starting, so under
  systemd or launchd it restarts in a loop. Every live dispatcher snapshot was
  checked against these rules before release and passes; quarantining instead
  of refusing is tracked in `bd-tqmak`
  ([`057bb508`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/057bb508fa9c1e9250541c5051f6c187b150974e)).

## 2.1.12 — 2026-09-29

- **`rch status` no longer tells agents to cancel healthy builds or drain
  workers.** A build whose progress looks stale while its hook is alive and
  heartbeating is almost always one large crate compiling silently. The status
  issue for it advised `rch cancel` and, if repeated, `rch workers drain`.
  Agents followed that literally: hz4 (64 cores) and vmi1152480 were drained
  twice on 2026-09-28 with no admin record. The issue is now informational,
  points at `rch queue --json`, allows cancelling only past the timeout
  budget, and says not to drain the worker
  ([`f144e978`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/f144e978622198b8f66ba13afe44b4c0d680a1ca)).
- **Worker drains, enables and disables are attributable.** rchd logs each one
  as "Worker admin action" with the outcome and the calling process: pid,
  command, parent pid and parent command, read from the socket's peer
  credentials
  ([`1410e9d1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/1410e9d13bd7faa97c8cacd2ddd68a50941f12af)).
- **`rch workers enable|disable|drain` exit 1 on failure** and print the
  daemon's message instead of the raw HTTP response. An unknown worker id
  used to print `HTTP/1.0 200 OK … {"status":"error"…}` and exit 0
  ([`a649dcda`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a649dcda93f9901b5948a4e272f0dffff8a95d41)).
- **Ambient `RUST_TEST_THREADS` no longer sizes remote reservations**, for the
  same reason as `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` in 2.1.11: it never reaches the worker
  ([`9806609c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9806609cc1dbb46252b61134cac2b0c61c314297)).
- **Release-gate flakes fixed** (`bd-04yji`). Three tests failed
  intermittently under parallel load and passed alone: autostart lock
  reacquire, shim stub exec ("Text file busy"), and a 100 ms streaming bound.
  This release's full `rch` + `rchd` run was 5,107 passed, 0 failed
  ([`5f1581a6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/5f1581a6fbc1925254a3dfd1a12ac2197fd396d5)).

## 2.1.11 — 2026-09-29

- **A dispatcher's local `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` no longer inflates remote
  reservations.** Every dispatcher sets `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` in
  `/etc/environment` to throttle local builds (16 on trj/css/csd/ts1, 32 on
  ts2), and the hook used that value to size a remote build's slot
  reservation. It never reaches the worker: the environment allowlist is
  empty fleet-wide, and the worker picks its own job count. So every
  `cargo test` without `-j` from ts1 reserved 16 slots. Only hz3 and hz4 could
  fit that, and ts1 kept refusing 36–59 builds per 15 minutes after 2.1.10,
  which then ran locally. Reservations now come only from `-j`/`--jobs` or an
  inline `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=N` in the command. If you allowlist
  `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` so it does reach workers, pass `-j` explicitly to size
  the reservation. `RUST_TEST_THREADS` has the same ambient fallback. No
  dispatcher sets it, so it is unchanged for now
  ([`f87eb024`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/f87eb024df41860a76b77c2af4bdfd6556b08351)).

## 2.1.10 — 2026-09-28

- **Builds wait for a busy worker instead of being refused** (`bd-141zu`).
  The daemon queues a request (`RCH_QUEUE_WHEN_BUSY`, on by default) only when
  selection reports every worker busy. But one worker in critical pressure, or
  one active-project exclusion anywhere in the fleet, turned "eight capable
  workers busy" into an immediate "no admissible workers" refusal. That was
  the most common refusal fleet-wide (~7.9k in 24h), and agents answered it
  with tight retry loops or local builds on the dispatcher. When a capable
  worker is merely busy, the request now queues until it drains. Each poll
  re-runs full selection, so a worker that turns critical while we wait is
  filtered again
  ([`c3e2d296`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c3e2d296d5be26c21bd21047d32949ba6538eeb9)).
- **Retrieved outputs are no longer kept twice on dispatchers.** Every
  retrieved job left a full copy of its artifacts under
  `job-leases/retrieval/`: 1,339 stages and 43 GB on ts1, and about 129 GB
  across ten dispatchers. The stage is removed once publication is durable
  ([`19ae7e2a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/19ae7e2a140d0766b7b209333380e864ff6c9aaf)).
- **A healthy build is no longer cancelled for one late heartbeat.** The stuck
  detector cancelled a build whose progress was stale (≥ 90 s) and whose
  heartbeat was stale (≥ 20 s) even while the hook process was alive. A large
  crate compiles silently for minutes, and a loaded host easily delays one
  heartbeat by 20 s. On 2026-09-28 a healthy 16-minute `cargo test` was killed
  this way, leaving an orphaned build and source claim
  ([`9f8692f2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9f8692f28ddbfef411650bb725558d5a98f838ff)).
- **Lost selection replies can no longer cause a replay or a silent local
  build.** A failed reply to an immediate (non-queued) worker selection is now
  treated as possibly admitted, like a queued one, and goes through the durable
  uncertain-lease path. A refused mismatched-worker assignment only reports a
  plain refusal after its release is acknowledged
  ([`36520ebc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/36520ebc8e58631f90daaac3ba95a6487ebff6bc),
  [`9ec9b32f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9ec9b32f36289be34d3c01c020d4c419f020dbf1)).

Fleet configuration changed alongside this release (not in the binaries):
uniform `[selection]` (`min_free_gb = 20`, `disk_gb_per_slot = 5`,
`max_load_per_core = 1.0`), `test_slots = 4`, larger per-dispatcher budgets for
dedicated build hosts, and a 150 GB per-worker target-cache budget. Summed
usable slots went from 397 to ~720–870, and concurrent builds from ~160 to
~220–235. Details in `bd-141zu`.

## 2.1.9 — 2026-09-28

- **A dead client can no longer wedge a worker's source locks** (`bd-m5ccr`).
  On vmi1153651 a client died while the SSH mux master kept its channel open,
  so nothing read the build's output stream. The durable-execution output
  follower's `head` blocked writing its last 35 bytes for 7 hours after the
  build finished. It had inherited the source-activity lock, so that lock
  stayed held, the worker's source-claim registry stalled, and 2.1.8's lease
  auto-recovery timed out. Followers now copy in steps of at most 1 MiB and
  record their progress. Once the build has finished, a follower that copies
  nothing for 120s is killed, and the wrapper exits with the build's status.
  The output files stay on the worker for `rch jobs recover`. A live reader
  slower than about 8.7 KB/s (1 MiB per 120s) would see a truncated stream,
  though the exit status is still the build's
  ([`ea5127d6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ea5127d649dd5ce41a2efc84316a915e999e5324)).

## 2.1.8 — 2026-09-28

Self-healing for two daemon states that previously needed an operator, plus
the end-to-end completion of 2.1.7's `--no-run` fix.

- **Dead job leases no longer fence workers until someone runs
  `rch jobs recover`** (`bd-nalyr`). When a wrapper died while its job still
  owned worker source, only a manual `rch jobs recover` could release the
  worker's source claim. Across the fleet about 15 such claims piled up per
  half hour and blocked overlapping builds with "unfinished overlapping
  source owner". Every 5 minutes rchd now recovers up to 4 leases whose owner
  is provably gone, backing off per lease on failure. It emits
  `lease_auto_recovered` / `lease_auto_recovery_failed`
  ([`9f166b22`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9f166b22a085c21f4833dfffad7c8bf795e3927a)).
- **A latched admission refusal clears itself** (`bd-20zhr`). One failed
  durable-ownership write (ENOSPC) closed admission for the life of the
  process: every `rch exec` was refused as "restart remediation is active"
  long after disk space returned. If the latch holds for two consecutive 30s
  checks, rchd now shuts down cleanly. systemd or launchd restarts it, and it
  reloads the in-flight builds
  ([`51f01965`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/51f019655d45c1cc0e444fdaf90615e81ae4c1d8)).
- **The new-layout `--no-run` fix now works end to end** (`bd-b7lot`
  follow-up). Two gaps found by a live check on the operator Mac after 2.1.7:
  - The recovery recipe derived its output policy from the delivery kind
    instead of the command's own kind, so it lacked the executable carve-out
    and skipped the very test binaries the live retrieval fetched.
  - The foreign-platform gate ignored anything under `build/`, so a Linux test
    binary could land on a Mac unflagged. The gate now inspects exactly the
    new-layout executable shape (never build scripts). A Mac requesting
    `--no-run` binaries from a Linux worker now gets an honest RCH-E327.

  ([`874d9701`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/874d97018c13a09dbb34c8be4250f3261fce20d2))
- **Test daemons die with their test** (`bd-b4hrx`). A test binary killed
  without running Drop (tool timeout, OOM) left its rchd running for hours.
  On hz3 one ignored SIGTERM and stalled a rollout's idle gate, which took it
  for a stale dispatcher. The e2e harness now passes its pid in
  `RCH_EXIT_WITH_PARENT_PID`. rchd shuts down once that pid is gone, and
  exits outright 10s later if shutdown stalls. Production daemons never set it
  ([`a958b26e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a958b26e8860494e2d478b28f38ba9723951388b)).
- **Unit tests cannot touch the host's rch** (`bd-61pp8`). Running `rch`'s
  unit tests on a dispatcher once drained all 18 live workers through the
  real daemon socket. Under `cfg(test)`, the config directory, config cache
  and default daemon socket now resolve to a per-process temp dir
  ([`74396e35`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/74396e354eb3ca2cf44351d0f1ec631ea2a0aa1f)).

## 2.1.7 — 2026-09-28

A faster hook, `--no-run` executables under Cargo's new build-dir layout,
permission-respecting compound rewrites, and restart and recovery fixes.

The `v2.1.6` tag (e3d87917) was never released. dsr's strict release mode
refuses symlinks in the tracked tree, and the per-crate LICENSE files were
symlinks. 2.1.7 is that gated tree with regular LICENSE copies and the
version bump, and nothing else.

- **Compound commands keep the user's permission rules** (`bd-08ele`). A
  rewrite like `cd x && <anything> && rch exec -- cargo build` answered
  "allow", which approved the user's own prefix without the prompt their rules
  call for. Compound rewrites now return the rewritten command without a
  decision, so Claude Code applies the rewrite and still consults the user's
  rules. Simple `rch exec --` rewrites keep "allow"
  ([`e745f471`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e745f4710660a6e169b9da30d87d02b96d60c181)).
- **Recovery no longer retries forever when the worker's output tree is
  gone.** If the remote path is provably absent (a GC'd pool, for example),
  the build is recorded as an artifact-transfer failure and retired, releasing
  its worker source claim. Any other retrieval error still retries
  ([`e3b42d54`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e3b42d5454bcb013d10b1df4b8ef7d5478b48040)).
- **Daemon restarts** (`bd-w2qrp`).
  - Restored builds get a 20-second reattachment window before the stuck
    detector judges them, since their heartbeat age includes the downtime
    ([`6f31701a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6f31701a9a9082cb99621397ed6072dafaaccd3b)).
  - Recovered queue rows are retired once their client is proven gone
    ([`ce1c4330`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ce1c43307a8993ba3176c77783edc2930b1dabdb)).
- **`cargo test --no-run` / `cargo bench --no-run` return their executables
  with a forwarded `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`** (`bd-b7lot`, known issue since 2.1.0).
  Cargo's new build-dir layout keeps them under
  `<profile>/build/<pkg>/<hash>/out/`, inside the `build/` cache the target-dir
  sync excludes. Retrieval now supports priority includes, matched before
  every exclude (in rsync, the Windows tar route and staged-output
  validation). Build-only test/bench retrieval uses them to return exactly
  `<crate>-<16 hex>` executables and nothing else from `build/`. Verified with
  real Cargo on a Linux worker.
- **The non-compilation hook is about 2.4× cheaper** (`bd-1nhd`). A bare `rch`
  hook request for an ordinary command is now answered before the CLI,
  logging, update check and async runtime start. On a quiet Linux dispatcher
  this is ~2.8 → ~1.2 ms per agent Bash command (page faults 701 → 310). On
  macOS the mean is 12.4 → 7.9 ms, and the remaining floor is framework
  loading.
- **`rch fleet drain/deploy/rollback` exit 1 when nothing ran** (held fleet
  lock, or no target); they printed an error and exited 0 (`bd-bddpd`).

- **Published crates ship the license text.** The eight crates on crates.io
  declare `LicenseRef-MIT-OpenAI-Anthropic-Rider` but packaged no LICENSE, so
  consumers could not read the rider the identifier refers to. Each now
  carries it (a copy of the root file), and a test requires it for
  every publishable crate. The obsolete "rabs crates stay unpublishable until
  A016" guard now states what is true: only `rch`'s three rabs library
  dependencies are publishable.

- **A worker that broke a build no longer attracts the next one** (review of
  GH #81). Since 2.1.4 a failed build whose command started remotely warms its
  worker's cache, including failures the hook itself blames on the worker: a
  missing toolchain or system library, SIGILL, a full disk. The warm worker
  then won the project's next build under `balanced`, and always under
  `cache-affinity`, and each repeat failure warmed it again. The hook now marks
  those releases `worker_fault=1` and the daemon records no warmth for them.
  Compile errors, test failures and interrupts still warm the pool. Needs both
  a new `rch` and a new `rchd`; either side alone keeps the 2.1.4 behaviour.

## 2.1.5 — 2026-09-28

- **Ghost reservations are actually released.** 2.1.4's release rule required
  that no remote process record path had ever been reported. The hook reports
  that deterministic path before launch, so every real ghost had one; 11 ghosts
  on mac-mini-old were retried and kept every cycle after its upgrade. The path
  no longer disqualifies a build. For an abandoned build (6 hours silent,
  wrapper gone, no lease owning source), a remote cancel that finds no record
  at all now counts as proof that nothing runs. That holds because the launcher
  publishes the record before any workload starts and refuses to start without
  it, and worker cleanup removes it only after the process group is gone. A
  record that exists still needs a confirmed kill
  ([`4f5cf01e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/4f5cf01e875eb97ebd27ac7ffa7bbec5ab3f7498)).

## 2.1.4 — 2026-09-28

Stuck reservations are released, `cargo publish` dry runs succeed, and daemon
restarts keep queued and recovered ownership. 2.1.3 exposed most of these; the
rest landed in parallel.

- **Reservations that never launched are released** (`a2fdbfc8`). A cancel
  demanded a confirmed remote kill, but a reservation that never reached
  execution has no process to kill, so the stuck detector retried forever and
  durable ownership restored the ghost across restarts. On 2026-09-27, 42 such
  ghosts held about 84 slots across 5 dispatchers. A reservation is now
  released without a remote kill only when all of these hold:
  - no process record was ever reported;
  - the wrapper has exited, or no pid was recorded;
  - it has been silent for 6 hours (ages survive a daemon restart);
  - no local lease still owns worker source.

  Each release emits `cancellation_abandoned_reservation_released`
  ([`a2fdbfc8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a2fdbfc8db09dbff4f1a019e53b70e58a53312a5)).
- **Streamed output can no longer lose its tail.** 2.1.3's polling `tail`
  follower still cut a slow reader's stream under load (9,897 of 20,000 lines
  on a uutils `tail` worker). The durable wrapper now copies each log by byte
  offset. After the completion receipt exists, one final pass reads to the
  final size, which is exact regardless of the `tail` implementation. Stress
  runs on two workers: 100 of 100 complete, with no added latency
  ([`dfd62bed`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/dfd62bed2431232391d2d34c11523f5650dcb976)).
- **`rch jobs recover` no longer fails forever on a stray staged file.**
  Out-of-policy files an earlier collector staged (such as `.rustc_info.json`)
  are skipped with a warning and never published. The job's real outputs
  publish and its worker source claim retires. An interrupted out-of-policy
  write still refuses
  ([`7577d7a2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/7577d7a28d0407e32ee901f99a0439a5086530ec)).
- **Daemon restarts keep queued and recovered ownership** (`bd-w2qrp`).
  - The FIFO queue is part of the atomic ownership snapshot, and queue
    departures are durable
    ([`37450681`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3745068104e440f0193a03ee63fcf88b3eb853db)).
    Restored queue rows can be seen and cancelled; waiters are not yet
    reattached automatically.
  - Recovered reservations for a worker missing from config survive until that
    worker returns
    ([`b8a3b954`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b8a3b954b73d6c2dc9e528125d46bcfb4af93e36)).
  - Shutdown stops the active-build cancellation task first, so quiet live
    builds are not declared stuck while the daemon winds down
    ([`2d4f09ed`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2d4f09ed11278a712f49a7ce5d33a95320730e85)).
- **Stale client receipts that still own worker source are kept**, so the
  recovery recipe that can retire the claim survives
  ([`51f98635`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/51f986356cca55dfa4d9d2b424f6c840ee35af70)).
- Large remote-execution and retrieval futures are heap-pinned, so debug builds
  no longer overflow a 2 MiB thread stack
  ([`d500c6cb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d500c6cb72756e4c2bbc02734fef41c4e10b039c)).
- **A small tmpfs `/tmp` no longer zeroes a roomy worker's slots** (GH #78).
  `rch-wkr` reported one disk sample, the fullest of the projects root, its
  alias and `/tmp` by free ratio, and the daemon sized slots, the free-space
  floor and disk headroom from it. A 16 GB tmpfs a few points fuller than a
  1.9 TB data disk left the worker `ready` with 0 slots. `rch-wkr` now also
  reports a build-disk sample (projects root and alias only), which drives
  capacity; pressure classification still sees `/tmp`, so a full `/tmp` stays
  critical. `rch workers list` shows the build disk when it differs. Workers
  running an older `rch-wkr` keep the old sizing.
- **A failed or interrupted build's warm pool now attracts the rebuild**
  (GH #81). Only a zero exit reached the selector, so after a compile error or
  a Ctrl-C the worker holding the fresh pooled target dir scored like any cold
  worker and the fix-and-rebuild often recompiled every dependency elsewhere.
  Any build whose command started remotely now records cache warmth on its
  worker, both on release and on cancellation. A non-zero exit still creates
  no affinity pin, no last-success fallback and no worker-health success.
- **`cargo publish --dry-run` and `cargo package` no longer end "completion
  unconfirmed".**
  - The remote run succeeded, but the live retrieval derived its output policy
    from the command after rch had added its quoted build-stamp `--config`
    flags. That made package verification look like a plain build, so
    retrieval staged Cargo's `.rustc_info.json`.
  - The recovery recipe had recorded the package policy from the unstamped
    command, so publication refused the file and kept the job's ownership.
  - Retrieval, the zero-package-archive gate and the build-only kind now all
    use the recipe's command (`bd-3kskq`).
  - The same mismatch disabled the zero-package-archive loud-failure gate and
    widened `cargo build --bin` retrieval to the broad policy.

## 2.1.3 — 2026-09-27

Everything on `main` since 2.1.0. It includes the 2.1.2 hotfix and about 40
further core fixes from two concurrent maintainers. RABS is unchanged in
behavior: experimental, operator-only, and not in the archives.

- **Builds that succeed stop being reported as failures.**
  - Durable remote output no longer loses its tail, which had dropped the final
    test verdict lines of green runs
    ([`447c5c45`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/447c5c453d506430b3bd4801375ed343ac7e4a8e),
    [`c4c405b5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c4c405b5706a1ee025b8400cab02bd3a89752fb0)).
    The follower now polls instead of using inotify: bytes written before the
    inotify watch existed raised no event, and once the command had exited the
    follower quit without a final read. On workers with uutils `tail` this still
    cut 5–8% of streams read by a slow client (8 of 100 under stress; 0 of 100
    after).
  - Output publication no longer refuses output roots that sit behind a system
    symlink such as macOS `/tmp` or `/var`
    ([`cb11a99c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/cb11a99c25ea415625bdf465c15c0f36e19deaf8)).
  - A killed wrapper (tool timeout, Ctrl-C, agent restart) no longer strands
    its worker source claim. The daemon had reaped the only lease able to
    release that claim, so every overlapping build on that worker was fenced
    off: 69 such claims were found across 9 workers, and those are being cleaned
    up on the fleet (`bd-dmg2k`,
    [`5ee860bd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/5ee860bd08dad4ff16324d5ce84cb74f0685ab0a)).
  - Remote builds run under the caller's umask again. The durable-completion
    wrapper leaked its private `umask 077` into the workload, so every output
    was created 0600/0700 and rsync carried those modes home; mode-sensitive
    steps (a build script watching a file's permissions) silently stopped
    rerunning. Only the wrapper's own receipt stays private.
  - `rch diagnose` no longer reserves a worker. It made a real selection whose
    release was refused, leaving a ghost build that held slots and fenced the
    project off that worker until the daemon restarted
    ([`b1b67881`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b1b678819a8dc80a51a6dca9dcbdd7665a63351c)).
  - `cargo --config=K=V <subcommand>` offloads again. `rch exec` re-quotes words
    containing `=`, and the classifier read `'--config=K=V'` as the subcommand,
    so these builds silently ran locally.
  - A rejected output set fails the build cleanly instead of stranding source
    ownership
    ([`42a92d82`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/42a92d8232f5a337612c01a4a698c2ece0dcffcc)).
- **Failures say why.** Remote-failure warnings print the full error chain, and
  a refusal after exhausted retries records it in the incident ledger's new
  `error` field, secret-redacted and bounded
  ([`32a6e2c2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/32a6e2c2f39fb1956745e9ce6773763ea3880585)).
- **Capacity heals itself.** An E104 orphan quarantine now records its probe
  evidence, and `rchd` clears it once the recorded process group is verified
  dead (`bd-g8m4g`,
  [`19d27eb8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/19d27eb80ba1f6653dfd8897e0f9ac62da752c28)).
  Quarantines recorded by earlier versions carry no evidence and still need
  `rch workers enable`.
  - A transient toolchain probe no longer excludes a worker for 10 minutes
    ([`bfbb0f3c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/bfbb0f3c88d22c2c9b2dbacdf7db30d5136cd855)).
  - Failover walks every untried worker
    ([`430c3129`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/430c3129ae51595002f3112ba15ed67f097f1f98)).
  - The worker orphan reaper runs again and protects cache dirs that a live
    process is using
    ([`40259f92`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/40259f9258284bbe6bae4cb863cd3df1dbe7a70e)).
- **Update authenticity.** `rch update` verifies each archive's `.minisig`
  against a pinned release key and aborts on a bad signature (`bd-oxxnk`,
  [`a3a97e6f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a3a97e6f6057068a9132ccc03091b33fc0337b22)).
  An explicit `rch update` always checks GitHub instead of a day-old cache
  ([`777cf1ac`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/777cf1acb1825276c257a9ab1e1d9e56fad9c107)).
- **Daemon robustness.**
  - rchd starts even when a recorded build's worker was removed from config
    ([`52f129d1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/52f129d1861fa61999048c01ccf3235a5cb4f935)).
  - Recovered builds can reattach on macOS
    ([`85e80a02`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/85e80a02f94da025dbf04fb84b3e256cf521c0c8)).
  - Terminal receipts are bounded, and heartbeats no longer fsync every time
    ([`55146141`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/551461418e548574def9d05c0c50e8fe295c0497)).
  - A persistently failing worker is no longer re-benchmarked back to back.
- **Other fixes.**
  - The `rch` test binary no longer overflows its stack
    ([`f57dd552`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/f57dd552edc5e33a2227c7bdca925355cd3641b1)).
  - Unresolved client toolchains are refused before dispatch
    ([`eb439c96`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/eb439c960e1d9ed44e0afa1506c7094c4212428e)).
    The client toolchain is now resolved by `rustup show` in the caller's
    directory, so a `rustup override` directory pin wins over a project file
    exactly as it does for rustup itself; a failed or timed-out query no longer
    selects an ambient compiler
    ([`115d4d84`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/115d4d842e64eb6a3b27619cb60fe09a36a38abe)).
  - A signal-killed local fallback exits 128+N
    ([`aec67ad3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/aec67ad36f09656ee8369990e77e5114a1b84dad)).
  - Redaction also covers `sk-proj`/`github_pat` keys, password-only URLs and
    any `*_KEY=`
    ([`ac846517`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ac846517a53d663bd2d4165928b19baa90b8a4fd)).
  - `--drain-first` leaves operator-held workers disabled
    ([`8776ffe0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8776ffe08a2215515701ab9b80bbc58271deb40f)).
  - `workers.toml` edits are made in place, and blank ids or hosts are rejected.
    A `workers.toml` that is a dangling symlink is written through to its
    target.
  - A selection preview no longer consumes a probe slot or bookkeeping on the
    affinity-pinned path. The durable-wrapper backstop can no longer leave a
    `sleep` holding the SSH channel or signal a reused PID
    ([`54a22cb2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/54a22cb23d30e2473834e9657c4c5549667b58a8)).
  - `FORCE_COLOR=false` disables color.

Known issue, present since 2.1.0 and newly visible: with a forwarded
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `cargo test --no-run`/`cargo bench --no-run` executables
are not returned when Cargo uses its new build-dir layout, which puts them
under `<profile>/build/` where the cache excludes drop them. The default target
directory is unaffected (`bd-b7lot`).

## 2.1.2 — 2026-09-27

Hotfix for a concurrency regression in 2.1.0. Upgrade dispatchers now.

The `v2.1.1` tag was never released: its commit
([`f07bcc83`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/f07bcc83a21857dab655eecefb57f18932e9c4b5))
accidentally included another agent's half-finished `rch/src/hook.rs` edit, whose
other half was still uncommitted, so the tagged tree does not compile. The 2.1.2
release ([`7558a276`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/7558a276574307827f8d4acada16c672ebdfc883),
branch `release/v2.1`) is 2.1.0 plus exactly the changes below.

- **Concurrent builds no longer fail on output ownership.** 2.1.0 took an
  exclusive, non-blocking lock on every local output root (the project root and
  any custom `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) at job preparation, and held it until the job
  finished. Dispatchers share one box-wide `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, and agents run
  concurrent jobs in one repository, so every overlapping build failed within
  seconds on every worker ("output ownership is held by another live wrapper").
  Under a remote-required policy those builds were refused; otherwise they fell
  back to local compilation. The lock is now held only while one phase's staged
  outputs are published, and it waits (bounded at 10 minutes) instead of
  failing. Files another job replaced after preparation are re-fingerprinted
  under the lock and overwritten (last writer wins, as with Cargo's own shared
  target dir). Recovery of this job's own interrupted write still requires the
  journaled evidence. Regression tests cover both behaviors.
- **Dangling Cargo cache links are repaired before Cargo runs.** If a worker's
  per-job cache has `registry` or `git` linked to a reclaimed `~/.cargo/…`
  directory, the link target is recreated instead of every crates.io fetch
  failing with EEXIST (`bd-hiu2v`).

## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-26

Cut from `main`: every change since 2.0.0, including the three fixes also shipped in
2.0.1. The detailed capability sections are under [`[v2.1.0]`](#v210----2026-09-26-release)
below.

- **Durable job identity.** `rch jobs attach | cancel | recover` act only on the
  identity-matched job and never replay a build. Queued jobs can be cancelled
  durably, and orphaned jobs release their slots once.
- **Truthful outcomes.** Only exit 0 counts as success in history and statistics.
  Deadline kills are distinguished from resource kills, and savings are not
  estimated without a local baseline.
- **Artifacts.** `cargo build --bin/--example`, `--no-run` and `-o` outputs retrieve
  only the named payloads, with a retry budget sized to the payload. Wrong-CPU outputs
  are rejected. Binaries carry the caller's source revision.
- **Source integrity.** Source-root ownership persists through recovery and GC.
  `--dependency-base` binds sibling repositories in clean overlays, and Cargo
  selections that would escape the overlay fail closed (`RCH-E413`).
- **Admission and visibility.** Memory-stall-aware admission and capacity that counts
  only admissible workers. `--require-tool` gates jobs on verified probes. Every
  local fallback is ledgered and summarized in `rch status`. The daemon exports OTLP
  metrics.
- **Operator commands do what they say.** `fleet drain` and
  `fleet deploy --drain-first` really drain, `fleet status --watch` refreshes, the
  dead `doctor --install-deps` flag is gone, off-root projects are decided local
  before a worker is reserved (and `diagnose` agrees), and `FORCE_COLOR` is honored.
- **Release-gate fix.** A fresh `rchd` no longer fsyncs its ownership journal
  between binding and serving the socket. On busy workers that stall exceeded 10
  seconds, and it was the root cause of about 30 daemon test failures.
- **Dependencies.** The asupersync 0.5.0 and FrankenSQLite 0.4.x upgrade from `main`
  ships here (`docs/adr/007-asupersync-revision-pin.md`, `UPGRADE_LOG.md`).
- **RABS remains experimental and operator-only.** It serves no automatic Cargo cache
  hits, and its binaries are not in the release archives.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-09-26

A patch release cut by another operator from a branch on top of 2.0.0 ([`3f66c37b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3f66c37ba029f62825e64cf89acf39ef04532c25)), not
from `main`:
[GitHub release](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/releases/tag/v2.0.1).
It carries three fixes, all of which are also in 2.1.0:

- Worker benchmarks are bounded by `timeout` on the worker itself, not only on the
  dispatcher.
- Every local fallback or refusal is recorded as `RCH-I011`/`RCH-I012` in
  `~/.local/state/rch/incidents.jsonl`.
- `rch status` shows the last 24 hours' local fallbacks and their top reasons.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-13

Published from `3289f5e4e977e001187e48976bcd89e4cca0c752`:
[GitHub release](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

- **Rust API break:** public schema helpers now return schemars 1.x `Schema`
  instead of 0.8 `RootSchema`. Generated contracts and CLI exports continue
  to use JSON Schema Draft 7.
- Add disk-aware worker admission, slot limits, scheduling preferences, and
  disk information in worker listings and probes. Avoid overlapping Rustup
  inventory scans and require fresh, healthy telemetry for startup benchmarks.
- Bound fleet GC with worker deadlines, concurrent progress, and explicit
  partial results. Warn about unmanaged builds on dispatchers and offload
  `cargo package` and `cargo publish --dry-run`.
- Fix Windows SSH quoting and source-lock handling, inherited Rust toolchain
  selection, PATH interception detection, and artifact download statistics.
- Advance experimental RABS with retained source snapshots, shared action
  submission, durable generation allocation, subscriber evidence requirements,
  and atomic metadata migrations.
- Refresh stable Rust dependencies. Preserve FrankenSQLite rollback and WAL
  behavior when joining its new connection worker during Drop. Fix webhook
  retry classification for HTTP 429 and server errors.
- Share the admitted RABS job budget through the correct namespace FIFO path
  and refuse execution when its setup fails. Keep human daemon status on stderr
  while preserving JSON status on stdout.

Known issue (`bd-cfv95`): cached clean-overlay test binaries can retain paths
to source snapshots that have been removed. For tests that read source fixtures
at runtime, set `RCH_DISABLE_TARGET_REUSE=1` until source-path validity across
pooled builds is fixed. The release test gate uses this workaround.

Signed Linux x86-64 GNU and macOS ARM64 archives each contain `rch`, `rchd`,
and `rch-wkr`. All six binaries report the release version and source commit.
DSR verified the eight public assets and both archive signatures after publication.
Linux requires glibc 2.38 by ELF imports and was tested on 2.43; the Mac binaries
encode macOS 11.0 and were tested on 26.2. Private retention-safe offline installer
checks passed on both platforms; stock online installs and upgrades were not tested.
See `UPGRADE_LOG.md` for dependency gates, original test failures and successful
follow-ups, artifact hashes, and retained limitations.

## Version Timeline

## [Unreleased]

## [v2.1.0] -- 2026-09-26 (release)

Range `v2.0.0..v2.1.0`: 532 non-merge commits in thirteen days before the release-prep
commits. 174 touched the core product (`rch`, `rchd`, `rch-wkr`, `rch-common`,
`rch-telemetry`, installer, dashboard, README) and 215 touched RABS. Many of those commits
say in their own messages that their new tests were not run on the authoring host. This
release's gate is what re-ran them, recorded in the summary at the top of this file. Two
defects surfaced by that gate were fixed here: a pre-serve fsync in daemon startup, and
four clippy lints in `rabs-wkr`.

### Durable job identity: `rch jobs attach | cancel | recover`

Every offloaded build now has a durable local lease. The lease records the wrapper's pid,
boot id and process start ticks, so a recycled PID cannot impersonate another job. The
daemon's job routes match on that identity. `rch jobs` lists the leases. `attach` follows
the original job, `cancel` stops only the matching daemon build, and `recover` reconciles
completion and fetches any outstanding outputs. None of them ever starts a second build.
Queued jobs can be cancelled durably before a worker admits them. Orphaned jobs release
their reservation once, and an uncertain execution is reported as a typed error, never
replayed. These commands are Unix-only and refuse daemons that lack the identity-aware
routes.

- [`4310d4b4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/4310d4b481fd32dbb7bc705ae08eef3e9d7d2e31): lease identity (pid, boot_id, start ticks)
- [`0e64c878`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0e64c878af20399d20b3db34258422f1c67d8136): identity-aware daemon job routes
- [`81255eb3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/81255eb336e6b0fe2e80e64d120f28d2e357cb98): the `jobs attach/cancel/recover` CLI
- [`7eaebf10`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/7eaebf1041afc20e07054f0fdffa4735c62cc2ed): durable queued cancellation and a separate queue-ID namespace
- [`b3e0c3bf`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b3e0c3bf2950b76158e2060138944c69f3ca14be): orphan recovery without replay

### Daemon cancellation, reload and startup safety

- A reservation is released only after the worker confirms that the build's process group
  has exited ([`3a231167`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3a231167ed048b80661855e77ab51058b169d378)).
- Bulk cancellation completes even if the caller disconnects
  ([`4e8fb584`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/4e8fb5847b41078ba8d80dd278cd019c4aad12f2)).
- A failed reload of `workers.toml` keeps the previous pool
  ([`c5065cbc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c5065cbcca665153218cf54485f592a6b124cedd)).
- CLI autostart hands off to a registered launchd service instead of racing it for the
  socket ([`e82d2ad5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e82d2ad58dd8abc0305cda748f98dee9192469e8),
  `bd-mhv3x`), and concurrent startups share one gate
  ([`950bccef`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/950bccef742485fdfe769bed869643e528e7a678)).
- **Fixed in this release:** a fresh daemon no longer fsyncs its ownership journal between
  binding the socket and serving it. On a worker with heavy disk writeback, that fsync held
  startup for more than 10 seconds while the bound socket accepted connections that nothing
  answered. This was the root cause of 30 daemon test failures at the release candidate
  (`bd-5rbv4`). A restart that recovers existing state still persists before admitting work.

### Truthful outcomes and statistics

Build and test history now counts a run as successful only when it exits 0. Before this,
Cargo's exit 101 and signal kills could be recorded as successful compilations. The
`build_error_runs` bucket is gone. Savings estimates read `n/a (no local baseline)` instead
of assuming a 2x speedup. Launcher deadlines are reported separately from other SIGKILLs,
and exit 137 is no longer reported as out-of-memory without evidence.

- [`81ac3ead`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/81ac3ead1c2b9eba774092886fcbad150ea8653d): success means exit code 0 (`bd-88fpl`)
- [`e69e2717`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e69e2717cb8a955cab34550b2530f11179bedba2): `build_error_runs` removed
- [`71ce8fb9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/71ce8fb99350d2784a66f4fac3b27aa456f88740): no savings without an observed local baseline (`bd-jtlp7`)
- [`e2b5b5e4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e2b5b5e4d8e9eeec8761e12efe309e6f76c8e4fb): deadline kills distinguished from resource kills (`bd-9zcwn`)
- [`793d0667`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/793d0667ee0c19175b2f47ac0a5fd2e3d0bdd53c): deadline watchdog no longer wedges on a full stderr pipe (`bd-1we6i`; one real case hung for 24.5 hours)

### Artifact retrieval returns what was asked for

- A literal `cargo build --bin/--example` retrieves only the named payloads
  ([`a241bef9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a241bef987455a50beb70b5c0ae03374f3737682),
  [`84d3ace8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/84d3ace8ca2cc4e7f3fba733b176a045cd37ee6f)).
  So do `--no-run` test and bench executables, and `-o` outputs from rustc, GCC and Clang
  ([`eb7caef7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/eb7caef7e341b0373157b3e1387ae4a69a84118c),
  [`57e365b9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/57e365b9243a0e19811b1eedf1ef6e0d84ac142d)).
- When no limit is configured, the retrieval retry budget scales with the selected payload
  size
  ([`5f1abbd3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/5f1abbd3c559e8dff5585116c286c8d147821ff5)).
  Windows workers return artifacts through one bounded tar transport that honors the same
  selection
  ([`5bbd5794`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/5bbd5794547ea92e430395f2640b56fefd9bc1c5)).
- ELF, Mach-O and PE outputs built for the wrong CPU are rejected after retrieval
  ([`c7dcb88d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c7dcb88d00891cc1e6bf21f8416969d7eb708a1b)).
- Offloaded binaries carry the caller's source revision (`RCH_BUILD_SOURCE`, including
  `-dirty`/`-overlay-<fp>`) instead of whatever Git metadata the worker has
  ([`50193e21`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/50193e21dd0a34331d9958b572e1b30aa2abb941),
  GH #76, `bd-xho6o`).

### Source snapshot integrity and clean overlays

Source-root ownership now persists through upload, compile, retrieval and cleanup, and GC
honors it. Nested or aliased roots are serialized. Clean overlays can bind committed
sibling repositories with `--dependency-base PATH=REV`, and the execution receipt records
each one. Clean-overlay Cargo jobs fail closed with `RCH-E413` if a source, `-C`, a
`--config` file, or ambient worker Cargo config would escape the selection. The
worker-side guard exits 113.

### Admission, capacity and required tools

- Admission also scores memory stall pressure (PSI)
  ([`626a3a1a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/626a3a1ac44f187fc663c853a5c7edeb2d84ec4e)).
- `/status` and `/ready` count only admissible workers
  ([`9e407c00`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9e407c0048f38fbe46c5cb008eee579379363a61), GH #75).
- Operators can declare verified tool probes in `workers.toml`, and jobs can require them
  with `rch exec --job --require-tool` or `[jobs] required_tools`
  ([`10e2b4cb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/10e2b4cbebb7a6d9bebc44fec1b570ad35e0a952)).
- Scheduled worker benchmarks are bounded on the worker itself
  ([`fb0344cf`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/fb0344cf6c1a119ce0e04f2e7c9eda5d3576a63c), `bd-tctxy`).

### Local-fallback visibility and dispatcher shims

Every local fallback or proof refusal is recorded as an incident (`RCH-I011`/`RCH-I012`)
with its reason, and `rch status` shows the last 24 hours' count and top reasons. The
dispatcher Cargo shims are restored from `general.role`, and `doctor` warns when they are
broken. Project `.rch/config.toml` is discovered from any directory up to the Git root.

### OpenTelemetry

The daemon exports real request-duration metrics over OTLP. `rch doctor --reliability`
exports verdicts, probe durations and remediation outcomes, and flushes before exiting.

### RABS (experimental, operator-only, not in the prebuilt archives)

RABS still serves **no** automatic Cargo cache hits. `rabs-wrap` always runs the real
rustc, and nothing in production publishes to or serves from the action cache. The RABS
binaries are not in the release archives or the installer. What landed is operator
infrastructure:

- **Authenticated worker transport.** The worker link moved from plaintext JSON with a
  fixed token to native Asupersync mutual TLS with ATP control framing. Workers are
  admitted by SPKI pin and incarnation, and plaintext is allowed only on loopback
  ([`970da905`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/970da905f342c2b05871d5208be6605ecba7b189),
  [`5c36703c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/5c36703c5237627608181c534ed5ed649305e9d4), `bd-085cm`).
- **Operator prepared builds and a durable job daemon.** Three commands move a prepared
  build through the pipeline: `rabsd --worker-prepare`, `--worker-build-tls`, and
  `--job-submit/status/wait/follow/cancel/resume/acknowledge/recover-local`. Together they
  ship an offline, locked source and toolchain bundle to a pinned worker, and they
  install the hash-verified outputs atomically. Recovery never re-runs the compiler
  ([`e9c33ec1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e9c33ec172795dde57ad7c04dbaa7a033d44a957),
  [`6c98907b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6c98907be78da71dda5bdf9a7d59de7ab9bc3b68),
  [`70f49148`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/70f49148662614e46c1bd01b80ebd7238966d7b0),
  [`2d3ad530`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2d3ad5303fe73810d68a8e67e32bbe4685dd5af2)).
- **CAS and manifest hardening.** Manifest namespace, hardlink and symlink validation,
  destination reservations keyed on raw bytes, sticky quarantine, and generation fences
  ([`0ba40a0c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0ba40a0ce8dbb8902032016c5fe8f2cf6ce84040),
  `bd-1rofg`, `bd-v9ho1`, `bd-9nnqm`).
- Known gaps at this release: the workspace-wide test run hangs in a `rabs-cas`
  crash-matrix test, and the new transport trips the nested-`block_on` architecture test
  (`bd-h3fu2`).

### Operator commands now do what they report (fixed at release prep)

- `rch fleet drain` used to print "drained" without contacting the daemon. It now drains
  each worker through the daemon, waits up to `--timeout` for in-flight builds, and
  reports `still_busy` / `idle_confirmed`. If any drain fails it exits 1 with
  `WorkerStateError` (`bd-bddpd`).
- `rch fleet deploy --drain-first` said "Active builds will be drained first" but never
  drained. It now drains, refuses the deploy if the targets are not confirmed idle
  within `--drain-timeout`, and re-enables the drained workers afterwards.
- `rch fleet status --watch` re-queries every 10 seconds instead of sleeping forever.
- The dead `rch doctor --install-deps` flag, which was parsed and never used, is removed.
- A project outside the configured canonical root is now decided local before a worker
  slot is reserved. The reason names the fix (`[path_topology] canonical_root`), and
  remote-required modes refuse instead. `rch diagnose` reports the same verdict. It used
  to say "WOULD INTERCEPT" while the build silently fell back locally (`bd-raobv`).
- `FORCE_COLOR` is honored as documented: `1` colors stderr without a TTY and overrides
  `TERM=dumb`, and `0` disables color. Only `NO_COLOR` outranks it.

### Behavior changes operators should know

- The SSH keepalive default is now 15 s (`ssh_server_alive_interval_secs`; 0 disables it).
- Success rates in history and the dashboard will drop, because only exit 0 now counts as
  success.
- A project's `.rch/config.toml` now also applies to nested crates. A repository-root
  `force_local` therefore keeps builds in subdirectories local too.
- New fail-closed clean-overlay refusals (`RCH-E413`; the worker-side guard exits 113).
- A missing, empty or comment-only `workers.toml` reload now fails and keeps the old fleet.
  An explicit `workers = []` still drains it.
- `rch jobs` refuses daemons that predate the identity-aware routes, so upgrade `rchd`
  together with `rch`.
- The RABS CAS metadata schema is now 23 (`credential_generation`).
- `rch doctor --install-deps` no longer exists.
- A build started outside the canonical root now runs locally without first reserving
  a worker, or is refused under `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE`, clean-overlay or receipt mode.
- `POST /release-worker` without a durable `build_id` is refused and not acknowledged.
  This has been true since [`0e64c878`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0e64c878af20399d20b3db34258422f1c67d8136); the e2e test now asserts it.
- The workspace is now publishable to crates.io. Internal path dependencies carry
  versions, and `rabs-protocol`, `rabs-key` and `rabs-cas` (which `rch` depends on) are no
  longer `publish = false`. Before this, only `rch-common` 1.0.26 had ever been
  published. The GitHub release notes record what was actually published.


## [v1.0.64] -- 2026-09-07 (release)

Three fixes for what happens *between* the hook and the worker, all reported from the field.
The headline is macOS: a stock `/usr/bin/rsync` on macOS 15+ is **openrsync** (protocol 29,
"rsync 2.6.9 compatible") and rejects every rsync 3.x flag rch used (`--info=progress2`,
`--compress-choice=zstd`, `--append-verify`) with `unrecognized option`, exit 1, before a
single byte moved — so on a Mac without Homebrew rsync every offload fell back to a local
build. rch now probes the flavour and adapts instead of assuming 3.x. The other two close
gaps found on the same fleet: an unpinned build offloaded to a different-platform worker
could rsync a foreign ELF straight over the caller's `target/<profile>/` tree undetected,
and the pooled Cargo target stores could not be moved off the worker's mirror filesystem.

**Delivered capability**

- **rsync flavour probe** (`rch-common/src/rsync_flavor.rs`, #66). `RsyncFlavor` classifies
  `rsync --version` as upstream rsync (with its version, so 3.1+, 3.0.x and Apple's 2.6.9
  are told apart), openrsync (with its protocol number), or unknown, and
  `RsyncCapabilities` maps that to the exact argv fragments each transfer builder needs.
  `resolve_rsync` picks the binary: an explicit `RCH_RSYNC_BIN`, then `[transfer]
  rsync_bin`, wins; otherwise a modern rsync in the well-known Homebrew/MacPorts/pkg
  locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/local/bin`, …) is preferred over
  a legacy PATH binary; only when nothing modern exists does rch drive the legacy binary with
  a compatibility argv verified against openrsync (`--progress --stats -vv`, zlib instead of
  zstd, cumulative progress and the zero-build-output proof degrade gracefully). The
  `--version` probe is capped at 5 s and memoized per process; `TransferPipeline` pins the
  resolved flavour for the whole job.
- **`rch doctor` gates on the probed flavour, not on presence** (#66). Modern rsync: pass.
  openrsync / 2.6.9: pass in *compatibility mode*, with the hint naming exactly the flags
  the resolved binary lacks and the platform remedy (`brew install rsync`; rch prefers the
  Homebrew binary automatically). Unrecognized banner: warning. Older than 2.6.9, missing, or
  misconfigured: fail.
- **Docs**: README "rsync Requirement (macOS note)" and the `[transfer] rsync_bin` example;
  QUICKSTART lists rsync as a prerequisite; the configuration guide documents `rsync_bin`
  and `RCH_RSYNC_BIN`.
- **Retrieved artifacts are typed against the requesting host** (`rch/src/hook/
  artifact_triple.rs`, #65, new `RCH-E327 BuildArtifactForeignTarget`). After retrieval the
  hook inspects the magic of executables under `target/<profile>/` (unpinned builds, expecting
  the local host) or `target/<triple>/<profile>/` (pinned `--target`, expecting that triple);
  Cargo cache trees are skipped and the gate fails open on partial evidence. A conclusive
  mismatch marks the local tree poisoned and tells the operator to rebuild for this host.
  Only kinds with an enumerable host output contract are typed (`cargo build`/`doc`/
  `zigbuild`); test, bench and coverage retrievals are the worker's by design and are not.
  `RCH_ALLOW_FOREIGN_ARTIFACTS=1` opts out for deliberate cross-build staging. The first cut
  opened the scope-stripped path instead of the manifest path and so could never fire; the
  follow-up fixed that and is covered by the module's ELF-on-macOS unit tests.
- **`[remediation.pooled_target] store_base`** (#64). Workers can place the multi-GB pooled
  Cargo target stores on an external volume instead of inside the project mirror. The
  hook's remote build commands, `rchd`'s stale-target sweep, `rch gc` and `rch cache status`
  all enumerate every scan root (mirror tree plus `store_base`), de-duplicated by path, with
  the byte cap applied per root. Docs now state the real rule for `[transfer] remote_base`
  (only consulted for `--clean-overlay` roots, Windows workers and `rch cache warm`; the
  documented `/tmp/rch` default was wrong). Existing stores are not migrated — setting
  `store_base` cold-starts the pool and the old directory is reclaimed by the idle sweep.
- **Toolchain**: `rust-toolchain.toml` pinned to `nightly-2026-08-31` (fleet-wide
  harmonization so shared hosts can drop extra nightlies).

**Closed workstreams**

- GitHub [#66](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/issues/66)
  — bare `rsync --info=progress2` rejected by stock macOS openrsync.
- GitHub [#65](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/issues/65)

- [`bd-o7w6x`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl)
  **filed, still open**: hour-long remote builds die exit-137 and are mislabeled "resource
  exhaustion"; root-caused to the 3600 s external build timeout, not ssh drops or worker OOM.

## [v1.0.63] -- 2026-09-03 (release)

A production daemon wedge, root-caused from a live sample. Every hook admission scans the
durable job-lease directory (`~/.local/state/rch/job-leases`); nothing ever reaped those
files, and once ~18k had accumulated the scan — which forked `/bin/kill -0` per stale lease,
synchronously, on the tokio runtime threads — monopolized every worker thread. The daemon
sat at 9% CPU, alive but unable to accept a socket connection (clients saw RCH-I010
"daemon socket refused"), and each wedge invited the CLI autostart to spawn replacement
daemons whose takeovers SIGTERMed in-flight builds (the churn filed as `bd-mhv3x`).

**Delivered capability**

- `is_process_alive` is a direct `kill(pid, 0)` syscall via `nix` (the crate forbids
  `unsafe_code`); `EPERM` counts as alive — the conservative direction for lease blocking.
- The lease scan reaps files that no longer block restart once their heartbeat is over an
  hour old, so the directory stays bounded by live work, not by history.
- Both async callers run the scan via `spawn_blocking`, so even a pathological directory can
  slow admissions but can never starve the accept loop again.

**Closed workstreams**

- [`bd-daspu`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl)
  — the wedge itself (P0), with the thread-sample evidence recorded on the bead.

  — the fix and its reap/liveness tests.


### Shim v4: `RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1` resolves a WORKING real cargo (tiered), fixing nightly-renamed-cargo hosts

The documented local-build escape hatch was dead exactly when it was needed. On a
host whose active toolchain cargo was renamed to `cargo-rch-real` (rch toolchain
wrapping, or a rustup update over it), the rustup proxy at `~/.cargo/bin/cargo`
cannot dispatch — rustup answers `the 'cargo' binary, normally provided by the
'cargo' component, is not applicable to the '<toolchain>' toolchain` — and the
shim's local fallback hardcoded exactly that proxy. So when remote offload
failed and the operator asked for a local build (`RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1 cargo
build --release -p rch`), the escape hatch itself died (2026-08-30 fleet rollout
of `943b8e29` on a nightly-default dispatcher; the working manual workaround was
`RCH_CARGO_WRAPPER_BYPASS=1 ~/.rustup/toolchains/<tc>/bin/cargo-rch-real` with
the toolchain bin prepended to PATH — which is precisely what the shim now does
by itself). Bead
[`bd-73gdn`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl):
- **Tiered real-cargo resolution** in every local path of the cargo shim
  (`RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1`, wrapper bypass, IDE diagnostics, the catch-all arm),
  first executable wins: `$RCH_REAL_CARGO` (new explicit operator override) →
  `$RCH_SHIM_REAL_CARGO` (the toolchain-wrapper handoff, preserving toolchain
  identity) → `<active-toolchain>/bin/cargo-rch-real` where the active toolchain
  is discovered via `rustc --print sysroot` (honors `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` and
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, i.e. the toolchain the build would actually use) → the
  stock `~/.cargo/bin/cargo` proxy, correct wherever nothing was renamed.
- **Toolchain-bin PATH prepend**: when the resolved real cargo is a renamed
  `cargo-rch-real`, its directory is prepended to `PATH` so the build's rustc /
  clippy-driver resolve from the SAME toolchain — a repo `.cargo/config.toml`
  with `-Z` flags (e.g. `-Z threads=4`) needs nightly rustc even when the rustup
  default is stable. The rch toolchain wrapper's own local fallback gets the same
  prepend (wrap version 3).
- **Loud failure with a named fix**: when every tier comes up empty the shim now
  exits 127 listing what it tried and naming `RCH_REAL_CARGO` and
  `rch shim uninstall` as the remedies, instead of exec'ing a proxy that errors.
- **Agent-facing docs**: the tier order is now printed by `rch shim install`,
  carried in `rch shim --help`, and embedded as a comment block in the generated
  shim itself, so an agent hitting a broken local fallback can debug it in place.
- Everything else is preserved verbatim: offload routing, the fail-open /
  loop-break contract, the local `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` cap, rust-analyzer handling.
  Hosts where nothing was renamed resolve tier 4 exactly as v3 did.

### Windows workers: pooled SSH never uses ControlMaster (wsurf permanently "unreachable")

The daemon's SSH pools (shared build/telemetry pool AND the dedicated health
pool) forced ControlMaster multiplexing for every worker — but Windows
OpenSSH has no ControlMaster support. On the Windows worker (`os = "windows"`)
a pooled session appears to connect and then every command over it hangs and
dies at the command stage, so each pooled health probe failed
deterministically with `Failed to wait for command completion` and the daemon
marked the worker permanently unreachable — while fresh one-shot SSH to the
same host worked fine (`rch workers probe` healthy, `rch check` degraded
15/16; 2026-08-30 incident on worker `wsurf`). Linux workers only ever hit
the same signature transiently and recovered via retries/circuit. Bead
[`bd-wgbx9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl):

- **Pool-layer override** in `rch_common::SshPool`: a single helper
  (`pooled_client_options`) derives each pooled client's options and forces
  `control_master = false` whenever the worker's declared OS is `windows`
  (the reserved `os:windows` tag from `os = "windows"` in `workers.toml`,
  case-normalized). Both per-worker client construction sites in
  `get_or_create_client_entry` route through it, so every pool consumer
  (health, telemetry, cache cleanup, reclaim, stale-target reap, toolchain
  preflight) is fixed at once. `SshClient::connect`'s existing
  ControlMaster-failure retry could not catch this class — the mux connect
  succeeds; the commands hang.
- **`control_persist_idle` is NOT separately neutralized**: it is consulted
  only when `control_master` is true (`control_persist_mode`), so it is inert
  once mux is off and is left verbatim. Non-Windows workers keep the pool's
  options verbatim in full — warm-master reuse for the rest of the fleet is
  unchanged.
- Unit tests cover windows/linux × pool-mux/pool-non-mux at both the helper
  and the pool-entry layer (plus `os = "Windows"` case normalization).

### Windows workers: command execution dispatches to the system `ssh` binary

The Windows ControlMaster fix above stopped pooled Windows clients from
spending a warm master on a slave that never replies, but the underlying
command-execute path was still broken: the `openssh` crate 0.11.6 cannot
execute commands on Windows OpenSSH at all. The connect step uses a
different channel and works; the execute step does not — the slave never
completes the command channel, so every command hangs at the
`Failed to wait for command completion` boundary regardless of mux,
keepalive, or persist settings (2026-08-30 fleet diagnostic, 6/6 option
combinations all 12-second timeouts; see
`/Users/jemanuel/projects/wsurf-openssh-diag/FINDINGS.md`). The pool-side
override (`bd-wgbx9`) is correct but the daemon never gets there for
Windows workers — `Failed to wait for command completion` fires first.
The worker `wsurf` (the only Windows box) has been permanently marked
unreachable ever since, hidden by the persistent bypass state. Bead
[`bd-nfusx`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl):

- **System-ssh fallback at execute time** in `rch_common::ssh`: three
  helpers (`prefers_system_ssh`, `system_ssh_argv`, `system_ssh_execute`)
  plus a dispatch at the top of `SshClient::execute_with_timeout`. When
  `declared_os(&config.tags) == Some("windows")`, the dispatch spawns the
  system `ssh` binary directly via `tokio::process::Command` with
  `BatchMode=yes`, `ConnectTimeout=8`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`,
  `-i <identity_file>`, the configured `ServerAliveInterval` (omitted at
  `0`), and `kill_on_drop(true)` so a timeout cannot leak an ssh child.
  Output is read concurrently off stdout / stderr with the same
  `MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE` cap the openssh-crate path enforces, and the result
  is a `CommandResult` with the same shape callers already consume.
  Linux / unlabelled workers keep the openssh-crate path verbatim —
  the dispatch key is identical to the one `pooled_client_options` uses,
  so the two Windows fallbacks cannot diverge on which workers they
  apply to.
- **Argv builder** is pure and testable. Identity file is tilde-expanded
  via `shellexpand::tilde` (the same call site as the openssh crate
  path), `WorkerConfig` has no port field so the argv has no `-p` flag
  (non-default ports travel as `host:port`), and the destination is
  `user@host`. The argv is `ssh -i <key> -o BatchMode=yes -o
  ConnectTimeout=8 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new [-o
  ServerAliveInterval=N] user@host command` — the same proven
  fleet-preflight arg set used by `rch/src/fleet/ssh.rs::SshExecutor`.
- **Unit tests** cover the dispatch key for `os:windows`, `os:Windows`
  (case normalization), `os:linux`, and an unlabelled worker; the argv
  builder for default keepalive, zero keepalive (omitted flag), long
  keepalive preserved verbatim, and tilde-expanded identity file; and a
  lockstep check that the dispatch key matches `pooled_client_options`.
- **Persistent bypass state is doing its job** (avoiding wasted probes
  on a known-bad worker) but will hide this fix until reset. After
  rolling out the new build, run `rch status --json | jq '.bypass'` and
  clear the wsurf bypass entry so the daemon re-evaluates against the
  new execute path.

### Custom cargo profiles sync their outputs; silent zero-output sync-backs fail loudly

Remote builds that write to a CUSTOM cargo profile directory (`cargo build --profile
release-perf` → `target/release-perf/`) reported success while syncing back only the
loose target-root metadata files (`.rustc_info.json`, `CACHEDIR.TAG`) — the actual
binary stayed on the worker and the LOCAL artifact silently remained the previous
build's. Observed across a 30-pass optimization session on franken_markdown
(`--profile release-perf --example fmd_perf_harness`: "4 files, 660 bytes" retrieved,
stale binary benchmarked unknowingly; every session had to md5-verify freshness or
fall back to `RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1`). Two layers fix it (bead
[`bd-mpbav`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl)):

- **Profile-aware artifact patterns.** `--profile <name>` is extracted from the cargo
  command during pattern selection; custom profile names (whose output dir is
  `target/<name>/`, unlike `dev`/`test`→`debug` and `release`/`bench`→`release`)
  now add `target/<name>/**` plus the `--target <triple>` form
  `target/*/<name>/**` to the default-root sync, and the rebased
  `<name>/**` / `*/<name>/**` includes plus plain and triple-nested cache excludes
  to the custom-`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` sync.
- **Zero-build-output detection (RCH-E326).** Artifact retrievals now itemize every
  matched regular file (`--info=name2 --out-format='%i %n'`, transferred AND
  verified-up-to-date). For kinds with an enumerable output contract
  (`cargo build`/`doc`/`zigbuild`), a sync-back that succeeded yet matched zero
  build outputs — every matched file loose metadata or cache state — fails the
  build with `RCH-E326` (exit 102) naming the stale-local-artifact hazard and the
  expected output dirs, instead of surfacing the remote's exit 0. Up-to-date
  no-op rebuilds are recognized (their outputs appear as verified-current
  manifest entries) and never fire; evidence-incomplete manifests (older worker
  rsyncs, mock/Windows transports) fail open.

## [v1.0.62] -- 2026-08-29 (release)

The one route the tailnet API was still missing. `rch status --json` folds repo-convergence
into its output, but a dashboard collector asking over HTTP got `/status` without it — so
API-collected machines could never raise `worker.convergence_drift`, and a worker quietly
missing repos looked healthy from the fleet view (bead
[`bd-ngln7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl)).

**Delivered capability**

- `GET /repo-convergence/status[?worker=<id>]` on the rchd tailnet API (`[api]` listener,
  `:9101`), token-gated like `/status`, serving the exact body the Unix socket serves.
- The dashboard collector (`dashboard/tools/snapshot.mjs`) issues it as a fifth GET and folds
  the answer into the synthesized status section, so `worker.convergence_drift` problem rows
  fire identically on API-collected and ssh-collected machines. An rchd too old to serve the
  route (404) leaves the convergence column UNKNOWN with a named `repo-convergence: HTTP 404`
  collection error — never a silent "no drift".

**Closed workstreams**

- [`bd-ngln7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl)
  — serve `/repo-convergence/status` on the rchd tailnet API.

## [v1.0.61] -- 2026-08-29 (release)

### Tailnet status API, 2-minute fleet snapshots, `web/` retired

Three changes that turn the fleet dashboard from a 20-minute-old picture into a
live one and let agents on any tailnet machine ask a dispatcher what is wrong
right now.

- **`rchd` tailnet status API** (`[api]` in `config.toml`, bd-2f5ms). The daemon's
  full `/status` JSON — the same body the `0600` Unix socket serves — plus
  `/workers/capabilities` and a new `/workers/config` (static tags/priority/slots)
  over TCP, bearer-token gated (`Authorization: Bearer` or `X-Rch-Token`,
  constant-time compare). `bind = "tailscale"` resolves the machine's Tailscale
  IPv4 at startup (port 9101); the bind address must be loopback or inside
  Tailscale's ranges (`100.64.0.0/10`, `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`) unless
  `allow_any_addr = true`, and the daemon refuses to start the API without a token
  unless `no_token = true` is explicit. `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`, `/budget`
  stay open on that listener too. A bad `[api]` section is logged with its fix and
  the daemon runs on without the API. CLI: `rchd --api-bind`, `--api-token-file`;
  `rch config set|get|show` know `api.*` (the token value is never echoed).
- **Collector over the API** (`dashboard/tools/snapshot.mjs`, bd-04ifk). A
  dispatcher written `name=100.x.y.z:9101` is asked over HTTP (four GETs, ~1 s for
  the whole fleet) instead of ssh; posture is derived by the CLI's exact rule and
  hints come from the daemon's `issues[]`. The dev-machine-local self-checks
  (`rch doctor`, `shim status`, `hook status`) still go over ssh, but only every 15
  minutes, cached. An API that does not answer falls back to the full ssh probe
  for that machine and says so. Dev-machine rows carry `via: api|ssh`.
- **Publish without a deploy.** `dashboard/scripts/publish-snapshot.sh` collects and
  uploads only the ciphertext to a Vercel Blob store every 120 s
  (`packaging/launchd/com.local.rch-dashboard-publish.plist`); the app and
  `/api/fleet` fetch it at runtime (`RCH_DASH_DATA_URL` / `VITE_RCH_DASH_DATA_URL`)
  and fall back to the deploy-time copy **saying so** (banner;
  `X-Rch-Snapshot-Source` header). `deploy-vercel.sh` now only ships code, hourly.
  The `/api/fleet` KDF cache no longer binds the ciphertext IV, so it survives the
  snapshot rotating under the same salt. Measured: fleet change → visible in ≤3 min
  (was 20–40).
- **`web/` retired** (bd-oxdl1). `rch web` no longer spawns a Next.js dev server
  nobody's installed `rch` could find; it opens `[dashboard] url` (or `--url`,
  `RCH_DASHBOARD_URL`) and prints the agent endpoint. `RCH-E900/E901` now mean "no
  dashboard URL configured" / "not an http(s) URL". Dependabot watches
  `/dashboard` instead of `/web`; the remediation e2e checks the dashboard's
  problems module. The `web/` directory is removed from the tree.

### Fleet dashboard: problems with actions, agent diagnose views, dev-machine self-checks

The `dashboard/` fleet console (Vite/React, encrypted static snapshot, deployed to
Vercel; first landed 2026-08-26 in [`6865d09`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6865d09)…[`e8ec3a7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e8ec3a7) without a changelog entry)
now leverages what the daemon already knew and collects three things it did not:

- **Collector** (`dashboard/tools/snapshot.mjs`): three new probe sections on the same
  single ssh connection — `rch doctor --json`, `rch shim status --json`,
  `rch hook status --json` — so a dev machine with **no Claude Code hook**, a stale or
  shadowed cargo shim, or **compiler processes running outside rch right now** is a
  named problem instead of a grey "idle" card. `daemon.alerts[]` and `daemon.issues[]`
  are kept again (they had been dropped as unread), along with active builds **with the
  daemon's stall detectors**, queued builds, repo convergence, test counters, and
  per-worker pressure confidence / policy rule / circuit recovery / bypass code.
  Remediation hints are capped worst-first, not daemon-order-first. An unreachable
  machine's detail is the ssh/rch error line, not the 2 KB probe script.
- **Problems** (`dashboard/src/problems.js`): one module derives the problem list for the
  page and for `/api/fleet`, so they cannot disagree. Every row carries `action` (the
  command), `on` (where to run it) and `since` (from the daemon's alert lifecycle);
  `next_actions[]` folds them into distinct commands per machine. N identical
  "dev machine degraded" rows caused by the same sick workers collapse into one
  `fleet.degraded` row naming the workers. New kinds: `dev.hook_missing`,
  `dev.unmanaged_local_builds`, `dev.shim_missing/stale`, `dev.doctor_failed/warnings`,
  `dev.daemon_version_skew`, `dev.collection_error`, `worker.convergence_drift`,
  `build.hook_dead`, `build.stalled`.
- **Agent endpoint** (`GET /api/fleet`, `npm run llm`): schema `rch.fleet.llm.v2`;
  `view=problems` (cheapest poll), `view=diagnose&target=<machine|worker>` (everything
  about one entity, incl. its per-dev-machine derated slot readings and what every other
  box says about it), `view=help` (the contract and problem-kind catalogue, no key
  needed), `target=` filtering on every view, `404` listing the known ids, `400`s that
  point at `?view=help`. Dev-machine rows now say `offload_pct`+`basis`, `hook`, `shim`,
  `doctor`, `local_now`; the summary carries `verdict`, `hooks_missing`,
  `local_builds_running`, `daemon_version`, `version_skew`.
- **Page**: a Problems panel (same rows, copyable actions, cross-links) replaces the two
  banners; dev-machine cards flag hook/shim/local-compile/doctor/stalled-build state and
  the drawer shows interception state, builds in flight with stall flags, and daemon
  alerts/issues.
- **Tests**: probe fixtures cover all seven sections and each failing alone; parity now
  proves the browser and endpoint paths emit byte-identical problem rows; endpoint tests
  cover help/problems/diagnose/target/404 and **fail** rather than silently passing two
  assertions when the passphrase is absent; four hardcoded-`true` checks in e2e/prod are
  real assertions; prod-check also hits `/api/fleet` and compares its problem count to
  the page's.
- **Ops**: the launchd refresh agent is checked in at `packaging/launchd/` with the real
  cadence (20 min, bounded by Vercel's deploy quota) documented instead of the README's
  10-minute crontab. Follow-ups filed: `bd-04ifk` (publish the blob without a deploy),
  `bd-2f5ms` (authenticated remote rchd API for live cross-machine diagnosis),
  `bd-oxdl1` (retire or wire in `web/`).

## [v1.0.60] -- 2026-08-28 (release)

### Local shim fallbacks capped (shim v3)

- Every local-exec path in the generated shims (`cargo`, `cargo-clippy`, the toolchain
  wrapper) now routes through `exec_local`, which sets `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` when it is not
  already set — the one lever that outranks a repo's own `.cargo/config.toml`. A committed
  `jobs = -1` on a 128-thread box had meant 127 concurrent `rustc`, each forking a ~1 GB
  `rust-lld`, exhausting RAM and swap while `rch shim status` reported every toolchain
  wrapped. Default cap 8; `RCH_LOCAL_MAX_JOBS` overrides; an explicit `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`
  always wins; the offload path stays uncapped (workers do their own slot accounting).
  `SHIM_VERSION` 2 → 3, `TOOLCHAIN_WRAP_VERSION` 1 → 2 — run `rch shim install` after
  upgrading.
- Disk-pressure policy adapts to small tmpfs mounts.
- Windows worker telemetry parses CIM samples for CPU/memory; `rch-wkr` resolves
  rustup/tool binaries with the `.exe` suffix (bd-jdcxd).
- Socket `reload` honours the launch-time `--workers-config` path (bd-xqg58).

## [v1.0.59] -- 2026-08-27 (release)

### Shim offload leaks fixed (shim v2)

- The cargo shim no longer sends every `--message-format` build local — only
  rust-analyzer's rendered-diagnostic formats stay local — and `cargo-clippy` is shimmed so
  direct invocations offload. A `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` guard keeps `cargo clippy`
  producing lints. `SHIM_VERSION` → 2; run `rch shim install` after upgrading.

## [v1.0.58] -- 2026-08-26 (tag only)

No GitHub Release exists for this tag: the installer and the fleet's nightly updater kept
serving v1.0.57 until v1.0.59 was published. The tag is dated 2026-08-26 (this section was
originally headed 2026-08-24, the date the notes were written).

278 commits since v1.0.57. Two themes: **RABS**, a new build-sidecar subsystem that lands
in full, and **job mode**, which opens rch's remote-execution rails to work that is not a
compilation.

### Worker-side rustc cap per job (#49)

- **`compilation.remote_build_jobs`** (default `auto`) exports `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` in the
  remote build session so one offloaded cargo job no longer forks `nproc` rustc on the
  worker. `total_slots` bounds concurrent *jobs*; this bounds parallelism *within* a job,
  which is the axis that was actually exhausting RAM. `auto` is computed on the worker
  from its live cores and memory as `clamp(ram_gib / 8, 2, min(nproc, 8))`; `off`
  restores the old behavior; an integer pins a fixed count. Explicit intent always wins:
  a `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` already in the worker session (e.g. `/etc/environment`), forwarded
  through the env allowlist, written inline in the command, a `-j` flag, or a project
  `.cargo/config.toml` `[build] jobs` are all left untouched. Windows workers are skipped.
  (Commit [`cf040af0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/cf040af0), in the v1.0.58 tag; previously mis-filed under Unreleased.)

(v1.0.57 shipped as a GitHub release on 2026-08-15 without a changelog entry; this section
covers v1.0.57..v1.0.58 only.)

### Job mode — remote execution for non-compilation work

- **`rch exec --job`** admits a command that the classifier would otherwise reject. The
  transparent shell hook's compilation-only admission is unchanged; this is an explicit,
  opt-in path for work that is deliberately remote.

  ```
  rch exec --job --result-dir fuzz/corpus --result-dir crashes -- ./fuzz_target.sh
  ```

- **`--result-dir`** declares directories to bring back, repeatable and order-preserving.
  It is refused without `--job`, so it cannot quietly widen sync-back for ordinary builds.
- **Job-mode admissions queue on active-project exclusion** rather than being refused
  outright. Previously the queue activated only for `AllWorkersBusy`, so a sharded caller
  hit `NoAdmissibleWorkers` and got no wait at all.
- **Exactly one structured result envelope per invocation**, emitted at every terminal
  path, with stdout kept envelope-only while remote command output streams to stderr. This
  is what lets a caller distinguish "the remote command exited non-zero", "rch fell back
  locally and *that* exited non-zero", and "rch itself failed" — a distinction numeric exit
  status cannot carry, since `RCH-Ennn` values are diagnostic identifiers rather than a
  disjoint exit namespace.

  Addresses the proposal in GH#27.

### RABS — Asupersync-native Accelerated Build Sidecar

A new subsystem across `rabs-cas`, `rabs-protocol`, `rabs-key`, `rabs-scheduler`,
`rabs-sandbox`, `rabs-action`, `rabs-replay`, `rabs-wrap`, `rabs-asupersync`, `rabs-wkr`
and `rabsd`. All RABS crates are `publish = false`.

- **Content-addressed store** with ownership-safe provisional recovery, a native-child
  gate, worker reconcile, and cache inventory.
- **Cacheability gating** that refuses to cache a build script whose output depends on an
  imported clock, with suffix-tolerant clock detection and a zero-divergence gate plus
  cacheability report.
- **Scheduler** with permit-chain total ordering, cross-edge single-flight, plane grants,
  and bounded lineage waiters.
- **Durable coordinator fencing** over protocol primitives, with worker fences and
  coordinator lease tracking.
- **Sandbox** network-isolation policy contracts and brokered-fetch lease validation, with
  canonical mounts and a namespace spec.
- **Edge cargo resolution** contract and snapshot validation.

### rch / rchd / rch-wkr

- **Worker-state hygiene**: multi-base GC, reconcile and inventory CLI, plus a
  mirror-ownership probe.
- **Honest disk-pressure reporting** and expanded probe diagnostics in worker selection.

### Fixed

- 26 fixes across the workspace, concentrated in `rch` and the RABS crates.

---

## [v1.0.57] -- 2026-08-15 (release)

547 non-merge commits, 2026-08-05 → 2026-08-15 (release published 2026-08-15, tagged commit
[`7013f4cf`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/7013f4cf)).
Two stories run in this window and they barely touch: (1) **RABS is born** — every crate in
the "Remote Artifact Build Sidecar" workspace (`rabs-protocol`, `rabs-key`, `rabs-cas`,
`rabs-sandbox`, `rabs-scheduler`, `rabs-asupersync`, `rabs-action`, `rabs-replay`, `rabs-wrap`,
`rabs-wkr`, `rabsd`) has zero commits before this range and a working shadow-mode spine by
the end of it; (2) **rch/rchd keep shipping independently** — fleet-role policy, durable
admin-disable state, CPU-capability quarantine, target-dir bloat reaping, and a batch of
release-blocking fixes landed the same week, none of it RABS. The GitHub Release notes for
v1.0.57 mention only the second story: RABS was still shadow-only. (v1.0.58, 278 commits
later, is where RABS lands in full.)

### RABS genesis — the master plan becomes a 513-bead epic graph and ten crates

Before 2026-08-06 the repo has no `rabs-*` crate; `COMPREHENSIVE_MASTER_PLAN_FOR_RABS_ASUPERSYNC_NATIVE.md`
(v1.6) is checked in the same day the workspace is scaffolded and immediately turned into a
full bead graph — Epics A through T (`remote_compilation_helper-rabs-root-4pidu.19` through
`.38`), 510 beads in one commit, corrected by a same-day "fresh-eyes audit." The next three
days (~330 commits) build the epics as pure libraries with no daemon wiring yet.

#### Delivered capability

- Ten new crates in the Cargo workspace plus the `rabsd` daemon binary, none of which existed at v1.0.56.
- `rabs-protocol`: five schema-version registries, a 23-family stable reason-code registry, a shared redaction/data-classification library, byte-preserving path/argv/env wire types, and requested→resolved snapshot-lineage sealing.
- `rabs-key`: declared-invocation-output derivation, a Layer-0 configuration pack with exact toolchain/capability detection, and the first `rch why`/DAG-browser explainability scaffolding.
- `rabs-cas`: schema-v13 durable content store with provisional-ancestor closures, adoption-edge tracking, ZSTD compression-policy tiers, and commit-ack gating on CAS + metadata durability.
- `rabs-sandbox`: canonical pseudo-file/locale/timezone/device allowlists, immutable read-only source-snapshot mounts, and deterministic OUT_DIR/incremental/temp/home path remapping validated by a cross-worktree acceptance harness.

### The bridge-plan pivot and the S1–S8 spine — RABS goes live in shadow mode

By 2026-08-10 the epic-by-epic build was producing correct libraries but no running system.
`RABS_BRIDGE_PLAN.md` records a same-day "reality check" and replaces epic-order execution
with a spine-first plan: get one real, live, end-to-end path working before finishing any
more epics. Milestones S1 through S8 landed in under 36 hours (08-10 to 08-11).

#### Delivered capability

- S1: `rabsd` boots a real `rabs-asupersync` runtime island (not a mock) on csd and hz2.
- S2: `rabs-wrap`, a tiny `RUSTC_WRAPPER` binary with a breaker-gated daemon consult, meeting an enforced 8.4 ms end-to-end p95 overhead gate.
- S3: a live UDS server in the rabsd edge region (with a same-day fix for concurrent daemons colliding on the default socket path).
- S4: a shadow decision plane over real production build traffic — computes real Epic-F action keys and emits pass-through "would-have-hit" evidence without altering any build output.
- S5: `rabs-wkr` worker session with orchestrated canonical execution, proven live on hz2.
- S6: the coordinator role boots in-process with leases/arbiter/singleflight mounted and leader/follower degraded-mode acceptance.
- S7: `rabsd doctor`, capability-gated fleet deploy scripts, and packaging/CI.
- S8: fault-injection chaos slice plus a compressed 24-hour shadow soak, both green.
- Post-spine hardening (08-12): rabsd refuses a cache hit whose materialized outputs differ from the caller's real work.

### Fleet reliability hardening — role policy, durable disable state, and target-dir bloat

Running in parallel with the early RABS scaffolding (08-06 to 08-09), rch/rchd picked up a
batch of operational fixes aimed at the worker fleet, independent of RABS entirely.

#### Delivered capability

- `general.role = dispatcher|worker|hybrid`: box-level fail-closed queueing policy replaces the old per-call `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE` env var.
- `AdminDisableStore` persists worker admin-disable state across `rchd` restarts (a restart used to silently re-enable a worker an operator had disabled).
- CPU-capability (SIGILL) fault detection: workers that fault on unsupported instructions are auto-quarantined instead of surfacing as false build failures; `rch-wkr` probes and reports the x86-64 microarch level (v1..v4) with a soft pre-v3 selection penalty.
- `rch cache status` and `rch gc [--dry-run]`: agent-facing on-demand reap surfaces, backed by an optional per-worker byte-cap LRU eviction policy and a long-TTL pooled-dir reaper for "immortal pool corpses" — the fix for target-dir bloat silently consuming worker disk.
- `rchd`'s restart-admission barrier no longer wedges permanently when a dead wrapper process holds a lease.
- macOS: `rch`/`rchd` prefer an existing `~/.config/rch/config.toml` over the `ProjectDirs`-derived `~/Library/Application Support/...` path.

### Release-week fix batch — the issues named in the v1.0.57 release notes

Every "Added"/"Fixed" line in the GitHub Release comes from a concentrated 2026-08-14 push,
three days after the RABS spine was declared complete and shadow-only.

#### Delivered capability

- macOS-native telemetry (GH #39): `rch-telemetry` collects real CPU/memory via `host_processor_info`/`vm_stat`/`sysctl` instead of returning zeros from a missing `/proc`.
- SpeedScore persistence (GH #40): `rchd` persists a worker's SpeedScore before marking its benchmark done, so a crash/restart mid-cycle no longer discards a fresh benchmark; unknown telemetry age logs as `-1` instead of `u64::MAX`.
- Durable per-worker cargo git-dep cache (GH #42): the hook keeps a per-worker `CARGO_HOME` across jobs so git dependencies are fetched once per worker, not once per job.
- Stable-toolchain pin fix (GH #43): `rch` no longer stamps a stable rustc commit date onto rustup as if it were a nightly.
- `min_free_gb` probe timeout fails closed: capability probes on loaded hosts get a 25 s budget so a timed-out disk-floor probe can no longer silently admit jobs below the configured floor.

#### Representative commits

## [v1.0.56] -- 2026-08-04 (release)

First published release since v1.0.53; v1.0.54 and v1.0.55 were git-tag-only
(GitHub Actions could not run the release pipeline), so their changes ship
here as binaries for the first time.

### Added

- **GH #38 — the canonical project root is configurable.** `path_topology`
  roots (`canonical_project_root`, `extra_project_roots`) are wired into the
  `rch config set` / `rch config reset` arms with validation, so fleets that
  do not keep code under `/data/projects` can point rch at their real layout
  without hand-editing config files.
- **Clean-overlay execution receipts and admission.** Successful clean-overlay
  runs emit receipts; concurrent overlay roots are guarded, root identity is
  bound, and isolated clean-overlay jobs are admitted correctly.
- **Durable client job leases and daemon restart admission guards**
  (bd-6xhh9.2/.3/.4), including retention of missing-worker bypass records.

### Fixed

- **SpeedScore benchmarks compile and emit finite, parseable output**: the
  compilation benchmark actually compiles, JSON scores are finite, and pretty
  `Score` lines parse; worker probes no longer report NaN/garbage SpeedScores.
- **Windows worker transfers** (v1.0.54/v1.0.55 content): tar/ssh stderr is
  drained concurrently (no more deadlocked transfers), retrieval can no longer
  clobber the source, and transfers are bounded by a timeout.
- Lockfile pruned of unused entries; benchmark/test formatting cleaned up.

---

## [v1.0.55] -- 2026-08-02 (tag only)

Two-commit follow-up to the just-shipped Windows worker platform. The Windows tar-over-ssh
transport piped the mirror process's stderr (local `tar` on sync, remote `ssh` on retrieve)
but never drained it — a chatty `tar` (concurrent writes, locked files, permission noise)
could fill the ~64 KB pipe, block the process, starve the stdout pump, and hang the whole
transfer; it is now drained concurrently via a spawned sink task. Paired with a docs pass
that generalizes the Windows-worker setup guide (`C:/rch` tar-over-ssh transport, v1
limitations) for use outside the original fleet.

- [`d629beee`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d629beee) fixes a latent deadlock in Windows transfers — rare in practice, but a hang with no timeout
- [`3c26f428`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3c26f428) genericizes the Windows-worker skill docs for other fleets

## [v1.0.54] -- 2026-08-02 (tag only)

Ships the first Windows worker platform. Remote compilation had assumed a POSIX worker
everywhere (rsync, `/data/tmp/rch`, `timeout(1)`); this threads a
`WorkerPlatform::{Posix, Windows}` through the transfer pipeline without touching POSIX
defaults. `SelectedWorker.declared_os` (serde-default) carries the operator-declared OS from
the daemon so old hooks stay compatible; Windows workers sync/retrieve via tar-over-ssh under
`C:/rch` (accepting both `C:/` and `C:\` as absolute overrides), skip the POSIX `timeout(1)`
wrapper and the `setsid`/pgid watchdog (which would otherwise hang SSH until timeout on a
successful Windows build), and disable streaming progress.

- [`27d95e5b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/27d95e5b) the platform threading itself — wire field, transfer pipeline, orchestration
- [`277848f6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/277848f6) locks drive-path parsing and the pgid-watchdog skip so the Windows path can't regress to Unix assumptions
- [`d1dc306a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d1dc306a) fills the new `declared_os` fixture field so the suite compiles under the wire change

## [v1.0.53] -- 2026-08-02 (release)

21 commits, but not a single linear line of work: the merge commit [`9f52da57`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9f52da57) ("integrate
origin/main with local RCH fixes as remote supersets") reconciled two histories that had
independently diverged from v1.0.52 — an 11-commit local fix branch dated 2026-05-15 →
2026-07-25, and 5 commits that origin/main had advanced in the same window — and the OS-gate
feature landed on top of that reconciliation. Author dates on 11 of the 21 commits therefore
predate the nominal window; they only reached `main` on 2026-07-29.

### Host-OS worker admission gate

Cross-platform fleets had no way to keep a command that needs a specific host OS (a
`*-pc-windows-msvc` build needing the MSVC toolchain, `*-apple-*` needing the macOS SDK)
from being routed to a worker structurally incapable of producing that artifact.

#### Delivered capability

- Opt-in `os` field in `workers.toml` (`linux | darwin | windows`) that makes a worker **exclusive**: admissible only for commands requiring that OS; a worker declaring nothing admits exactly as before.
- Requirement derived from the command's `--target` triple (`*-pc-windows-msvc` → windows, `*-apple-*` → darwin; `*-pc-windows-gnu`/wasm stay unconstrained), reusing the existing `SelectionRequest::command` field so the gate holds across mixed `rch`/`rchd` versions in one fleet.
- Gate enforced in three independent places (`WorkerSelector::get_eligible_workers`, `try_fallback`, `build_selection_diagnostics`) so `rch status` reports the exclusion as `os.declared_mismatch` instead of disagreeing with the scheduler; no admissible worker falls back to local rather than dispatching to a host that can't build it.
- Corrected `WORKERS.md`/`workers-template.toml`, which had documented a `required_tags` gate that never existed in source (tags are descriptive only).
- Repaired a `main` compile break the merge reconciliation had introduced (`ErrorCode::BuildCargoWorkspaceInheritance` missing a `description()` arm; a dead closure in `status.rs`).

#### Representative commits

- [`974ac383`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/974ac383) the OS-gate feature itself, gated in three places for consistency
- [`08b2fcf9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/08b2fcf9) restores workspace-inheritance error handling the merge reconciliation had dropped
- [`a4f7e8bc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a4f7e8bc) repairs the resulting `main` compile break
- [`ef21509c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ef21509c) documents the gate and retracts the phantom `required_tags` claim

### Local fixes branch reconciled: path-topology, worker pins, fleet pressure, transfer stalls

An 11-commit local branch (2026-05-15 → 2026-07-25) covering path-dependency workspace
sync, worker-pin selection, fleet-pressure visibility, and transfer-stall bounding had
drifted from `origin/main` by roughly 488 upstream commits before [`9f52da57`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9f52da57) reconciled the
two "best of both," explicitly keeping local intent where remote had not yet absorbed it.

#### Delivered capability

- Policy-normalized absolute path dependencies allowed through path-topology; path-dependency workspace sync roots isolated per project; synced-manifest path attributes rewritten and workspace-inherited path dependencies synced.
- `rch status` surfaces pressure-blocked fleet state instead of hiding it.
- `preferred_workers` is an authoritative pin — both `WorkerSelector` and the legacy selection path return `NoMatchingWorkers` rather than silently substituting a different eligible worker.
- Artifact transfer stalls bounded; the remote-required non-compilation refusal gets its own error code.
- Remote sync topology and manifest rewriting driven from `PathTopologyPolicy`/config instead of hardcoded `/dp → /data/projects` and `/tmp/rch-sync` constants; a `replace_sources()` pass that had been corrupting non-path manifest metadata was dropped for the targeted rewriter; floating rust channels (`stable`/`beta`/`nightly`) matched by family instead of exact version, so a plain-`nightly` project stops being refused by every worker on a different nightly date.

#### Representative commits

- [`4f7931e0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/4f7931e0) isolates path-dependency workspace sync roots
- [`6fea0b34`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6fea0b34) makes worker pins authoritative instead of a soft hint
- [`ac84dd29`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ac84dd29) bounds artifact transfer stalls
- [`e3bbabdb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e3bbabdb) drives remote sync from configuration, drops the corrupting source-rewrite pass
- [`8daea511`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8daea511) matches floating rust channels by family, not exact date/version

Three of these commits carry bracketed tracker refs (`[br-bd-3bhcb]`, `[br-bd-17c65.10.19]`,
`[br-bd-17c65.10.17.1.3]`) that do not resolve to any record in the current
`.beads/issues.jsonl`; they are quoted from the commit messages, not linked.

### Upstream fleet-refusal legibility and capability probing

While the local branch above was in flight, `origin/main` independently shipped a self-audit
batch fix (issues #30–#35) for refusal legibility plus per-toolchain capability probing,
merged into the same reconciliation.

#### Delivered capability

- Refusals route through `summary_critical()` (always-on stderr) instead of the default-silent `summary()`, so an `rc=1` refusal is no longer indistinguishable from a crashed toolchain; retryable refusals get exit code 103 versus exit 1 for permanent ones.
- Stale worker-side `target/` residue is no longer re-pulled onto the local project root when a custom `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is in play (previously a spurious E309 on otherwise-complete builds).
- The capability probe records installed rustup **components** per toolchain, not just toolchains/targets — a worker missing `clippy`/`rustfmt` for the pinned nightly used to report healthy and get routed lint work it silently failed.

#### Closed workstreams

- [`bd-vc61a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl) Capability probe records toolchains/targets but not COMPONENTS
- [`bd-u9mo8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/blob/main/.beads/issues.jsonl) `rch shim install|status|uninstall` (canonical cargo wrapper) — closure recorded; the feature shipped in v1.0.52

#### Representative commits

- [`10198772`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/10198772) refusal-legibility and stale-target-pull batch fix (rch#30–35)
- [`85398183`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/85398183) per-toolchain COMPONENTS probing (bd-vc61a)
- [`9318f5c7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9318f5c7) files bd-68hon (worker CPU-capability SIGILL auto-handling), root-caused live against the Ivy Bridge `ovh-b` worker; closed later, in v1.0.57

## [v1.0.52] -- 2026-07-23 (release)

### Added

- **`rch shim install|status|uninstall` — the canonical cargo offload wrapper.**
  rch only auto-intercepts builds via the Claude Code PreToolUse hook, so Codex,
  plain shells, scripts, and CI — which invoke `cargo` directly with no hook — were
  compiling **locally** on orchestrator boxes, defeating the point of rch. rch already
  honored a cargo-wrapper contract (it sets `RCH_CARGO_WRAPPER_BYPASS=1` on local
  fallback) but never shipped the wrapper, so every box hand-rolled one or had none.
  This ships the ONE canonical wrapper as a first-class command:
  - harness-agnostic — every agent that runs `cargo` via `PATH` now offloads;
  - loop-safe (honors `RCH_CARGO_WRAPPER_BYPASS`), fails open if `rch` is absent, and
    leaves rust-analyzer (`--message-format`) builds local;
  - offloads only `build|test|check|clippy|bench|doc|nextest`; everything else is local;
  - installs to a dedicated `~/.rch/shims/` (not `~/.local/bin`, which acfs manages);
  - `--allow-local-fallback` toggles fail-open; default is fail-closed (queue for a
    worker, never build locally) — appropriate for a dispatcher box;
  - `rch shim status` reports version drift, `PATH` order, and any local builds running.

  Install **only** on dispatcher boxes (that offload OUT); never on a worker box (a
  worker runs cargo via `rch-wkr` and the shim would re-offload/loop). Part of a larger
  effort tracked as an epic (dispatcher `general.role`, a loud local-build alarm, and
  install/watchdog durability to follow).

### Fixed

- Tidied two nightly-clippy findings (`collapsible_if`, `manual_contains`) in the
  linked-git-worktree upload path so the tree is clean under `-D warnings`.

---

## [v1.0.51] -- 2026-07-22 (release)

### Fixed

- **The bypass↔telemetry stranding deadlock that silently dropped the whole fleet
  to local builds.** A circuit trip quarantined a worker and persisted a
  `BypassRecord`; the telemetry poller then skipped quarantined workers, but the
  bypass recovery gate requires *fresh telemetry* before promoting a worker — so a
  quarantined worker could never produce the evidence needed for its own recovery.
  Restarting `rchd` did not help, because `reconcile_on_start` re-applied the
  persisted record. Meanwhile every offload fell back to local execution with no
  fleet-level signal (root cause of the 2026-07-16 offload meltdown).
  `should_poll_worker` now gates on the **admin** axis (`AdminIntent::Drained |
  Disabled`) instead of `WorkerStatus`, which collapses every quarantine state into
  `Unreachable`.
- **`rch workers enable` is now durable.** The enable handler deletes the persisted
  bypass record (mirroring `rejoin`), so an operator re-enable survives a daemon
  restart instead of being re-quarantined from disk on the next start.
- **Health probes no longer cascade into fleet-wide quarantine.** Health checks get
  their own SSH ControlMaster pool, separate from the shared build/telemetry pool.
  The health probe is what opens the circuit that quarantines a worker, so a single
  wedged control socket could previously false-fail every probe at once.
- **`cargo zigbuild` is no longer dispatched to workers that cannot run it.**
  `CargoZigbuild` mapped to `RequiredRuntime::Rust`, and the finer `needs_zig` check
  is only enforced by `assess_admissibility`, which the daemon's selection path never
  calls — so any rustc-capable worker was admitted. On a worker without
  cargo-zigbuild the build fails with `error: no such command: 'zigbuild'`, which
  matches neither `is_toolchain_failure` nor `detect_worker_system_dependency_failure`,
  so the nonzero exit reached the user verbatim instead of falling open to local.

### Added

- **`cargo zigbuild` cross-compile offload.** New `CompilationKind::CargoZigbuild`
  covering both `cargo zigbuild ...` and the standalone `cargo-zigbuild` binary
  (build forms only). Artifact retrieval is triple-aware — cargo-zigbuild always
  builds for an explicit `--target`, so output lands under
  `target/<triple>/<profile>/`, which the ordinary Rust globs miss entirely — with
  triple-nested cache excludes on the custom-`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` path.
- **`RequiredRuntime::Zig`**, gated on `WorkerCapabilities::has_zig()`, which requires
  **both** `zig` and `cargo-zigbuild`: zig alone cannot run the subcommand, and
  cargo-zigbuild alone cannot link (it shells out to `zig cc`). `rch-wkr` probes both.
- **Fleet-degraded alarm.** `rchd` now emits an edge-triggered warning when ≥75% of
  the last 20 selections returned no worker (clearing at ≤40%), so a fleet-wide silent
  local fallback is visible in the daemon journal instead of only in per-hook output.

### Upgrade notes

- **Upgrade `rch-wkr` on workers, not just the orchestrators.** Worker selection reads
  capabilities from `rch-wkr capabilities` JSON. Until the new `rch-wkr` is deployed,
  `zig_version`/`cargo_zigbuild_version` are absent, `has_zig()` is false, and
  zigbuilds run locally rather than offloading — the safe direction, and it
  self-resolves on worker upgrade.
- `RequiredRuntime` gained a `Zig` variant, which appears in the `SelectionRequest`
  wire format. Keep `rch` and `rchd` at the same version, as with the Go/TypeScript
  offload in 1.0.48.

---

## [v1.0.50] -- 2026-07-17 (draft release — never published)

`gh release view v1.0.50` reports `isDraft: true` with no publish date: the tag exists and
the notes below describe what it carries, but nothing was ever served from it; installers
skipped from v1.0.49 to v1.0.51.

### Added

- **Fail-closed clean-overlay remote proofs for shared working trees.** `rch
  exec` now accepts an immutable `--base <commit>` plus `--clean-overlay` and
  explicit `--overlay-path` selections (or `--no-overlay`). The remote source
  tree is built from `git archive` and only the selected, validated paths are
  overlaid, so unrelated local dirt cannot enter a proof build. The pipeline
  rejects deletions, type changes, symlink or submodule surfaces, ambiguous
  spellings, export-affecting attributes, source mutation during capture, and
  post-transfer fingerprint drift. Clean-overlay execution is remote-only and
  never falls back to the ambient local tree.

### Fixed

- **Shell suffix classification is byte-faithful and fail-closed.** Benign
  pipes, redirects, and backgrounding remain offloadable without rewriting
  file-descriptor adjacency, while embedded newlines and carriage returns are
  rejected before a command can be re-emitted.
- **Release gates remain deterministic inside isolated overlays.** Doctor
  startup probes now honor explicit test binaries, generated Cargo fixtures
  declare standalone workspaces, and compact harness directory identifiers keep
  Unix-domain socket paths below the platform limit.

---

## [v1.0.49] -- 2026-07-15 (release)

### Polyglot offload: Go, TypeScript, and Nix join the fleet

Through v1.0.47, rch only offloaded Cargo/rustc (plus gcc/bun/node). Agent swarms running
`go build`, `go test`, `tsc`, or `nix build` got zero interception — every one of those ran
locally, so a dispatch box could carry a load average over 100 while dozens of Rust-only
worker slots sat idle. This wave adds real classification and worker capability gating for
three more toolchains, plus a correctness fix for cross-repo Cargo path dependencies that
could otherwise silently desync a remote build. Landed via PR #29.

#### Delivered capability

- New `CompilationKind::{GoBuild, GoTest, GoVet, Tsc}` — the `workers.toml` `tags = ["bun","go","rust"]` entries had implied Go/TS offload worked since day one; `required_tags` was never read anywhere, so it never did.
- Nix build/test routing: `nix build`, legacy `nix-build`, `nix flake check`, and non-interactive `nix develop -c` / `nix shell -c` are classified and routed only to workers that probe a real `nix` binary with a populated `/nix/store`; interactive/mutating Nix subcommands fall back to local.
- `node_modules` is provisioned worker-side for `tsc` instead of rsynced (macOS-native `.node` binaries would be unusable on a Linux worker).
- The PreToolUse hook stopped attaching an ambient rustup toolchain to non-Rust dispatches (a `go build` was carrying `nightly-2026-07-11` along for the ride).
- `fix(cargo): materialize every local path closure` — derives a manifest-only materialization closure (normal/build/dev/target/optional/workspace-inherited/patch/transitive path deps) separate from the active cargo-metadata execution DAG, and fails closed with a new `RCH-E415` (with actionable evidence) instead of silently syncing only the primary root.
- Installer: an active system-level `rchd.service` is treated as authoritative on worker hosts, so Easy Mode no longer installs a redundant user-level daemon that nightly updates could resurrect alongside root's (issue #28).

#### Representative commits

There is no `v1.0.48` tag: the sequence goes straight from v1.0.47 to v1.0.49.

## [v1.0.47] -- 2026-07-02 (release)

Two-commit release shipping one large, deliberately atomic fix:
[`facb7b2d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/facb7b2d)
`feat(rchd): self-healing worker circuits + SSH connection reuse; managed build-artifact dirs`.
A fleet audit found the periodic daemon subsystems (health, telemetry, capability probe,
cache-cleanup, stale-target-reap, reclaim, toolchain probe) each opening fresh SSH sessions,
and the resulting handshake flood (~72/min) was itself making healthy workers look
unreachable and tripping their circuit breakers. The fix threads one shared `SshPool` (warm
`ControlMaster`, bounded `ControlPersist`) through every subsystem, collapsing that to ~12
warm masters; unifies the two circuit-breaker stores into one source of truth via
`CircuitStats::apply_health_outcome` so `enable()` and a successful benchmark actually
reset/promote state, half-open recovery needs exactly `success_threshold` clean probes, and a
transient half-open failure no longer reopens the circuit; and defaults the remote
build-artifact prefix (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`/`TMPDIR`/Go caches) to the managed `/data/tmp/rch`
zone instead of leaking into unscanned paths (root cause of a 241 GB `/root/cass-ft-target`
filling a worker). The second commit
([`0c22f427`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0c22f427))
files the Nix-offload design bead that lands in v1.0.49.

The orphan tag `rch-local-superseded-20260710` (2026-07-09) sits only on local backup
branches and is not an ancestor of any release: an abandoned parallel-agent branch that
reimplemented the same SSH-pool + circuit-breaker idea already shipped in [`facb7b2d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/facb7b2d).

## [v1.0.46] -- 2026-06-25 (release)

Small CI-hardening release closing the trailing edge of the session-history-remediation
program. [`bfa76f3b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/bfa76f3b)
and [`71727d57`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/71727d57)
add a release-asset-completeness gate plus a linux-musl row to the test-release matrix, then
rework the gate to be installability/platform-based rather than a brittle file-count check
(`bd-qb0if`). [`90ff452a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/90ff452a)
closes `bd-o0lxa`, confirming the cosign-tolerance self-update fix (PR #25) was
independently validated.

## [v1.0.45] -- 2026-06-25 (release)

### Session-history-remediation program: closeout (epics 7, 10, 16 + root)

`bd-session-history-remediation-ocv9i` — "RCH session-history remediation program from
complete history analysis" — was the dominant epic across v1.0.42 and v1.0.45, built from a
full audit of real agent session logs. This release closes its remaining P0/P1 sub-epics:
OS/arch-aware fleet update with release-provenance verification (epic 7), capacity-queue
semantics under multi-agent load (epic 10), and cross-cutting fault-injection/release gates
via a real-fleet smoke/soak profile (epic 16) — then closes the root program itself.

#### Delivered capability

- Release-provenance verification + deploy audit: a fleet-deploy enforcement gate, so a worker binary that doesn't match the expected release provenance is refused rather than silently deployed.
- `rch self-test --smoke --load` real-fleet profile: `DesiredVsLiveFleet`, `ProofModeRefusal`, `cargo_canary`/`artifact_retrieval`/`queue_attach_cancel`, disk/inode admission, and capabilities smoke scenarios — each built against a mock-SSH executor and then proven live against the real fleet, fixing two daemon canary bugs only the live run surfaced.
- Multi-agent storm-control E2E foundation, proven live on a 12-worker fleet (epic 10.4) — validates queue-when-busy and job-reattach semantics under real concurrent load.
- A CI/release validation-matrix gate with close-reason evidence audit (epic 16.5).
- rch#23 fleet-packaging fixes: workspace deps switched from absolute `/dp` paths to crates.io, a linux-x86_64 prebuilt fallback (musl → gnu) for the installer, and a clean-checkout CI guard.
- Cosign-tolerant signature verification lands on `main` via PR #25 — the same fix v1.0.44 had already fleet-deployed off a divergent branch.
- Hook classifier: cargo/rustc wrapped in a benign pipe, redirect, background `&`, or `bash -c "..."` was previously rejected by the Tier-1 structural filter and run locally — since those are the dominant agent invocation forms, `force_remote=true` orchestrators were silently defeated, producing exactly the local rustc storms rch exists to prevent (issue #24). `classify_command` now handles both safely at depth 0.
- `zcecy.14` (hook hot-path de-monolithization) closes: `hook.rs` down to 1992 lines via five submodule extractions.

## [v1.0.44] -- 2026-06-24 (release)

Fleet hotfix built off v1.0.43 (the deployed baseline) plus two cherry-picked `main` fixes,
built locally because GitHub Actions was gridlocked (50+ hour queue). Headline: `rch update`
no longer hard-fails on hosts without `cosign`
([`d67e6022`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d67e6022)) —
signature verification degrades to a warning (checksum stays enforced) when a release ships
a sigstore bundle but `cosign` isn't installed, unblocking self-update across the cosign-less
worker fleet. Also cherry-picks a stalled-Cargo-git-fetch classifier
([`41405976`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/41405976))
and a bound on piggyback telemetry collection so a finished build's optional telemetry run
can no longer keep it looking "active." Only aarch64-darwin and x86_64-linux-gnu assets were
built; the same cosign fix later landed formally on `main` via PR #25 in v1.0.45.

## [v1.0.43] -- 2026-06-19 (release)

Single-commit release:
[`141ae56b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/141ae56b)
`feat(routing): source preferred_workers from project .rch/config.toml` — per-project
worker-preference routing, built directly on v1.0.42.

## [v1.0.42] -- 2026-06-18 (release)

The largest release in this span — 190 commits over ten days (2026-06-08 → 2026-06-18),
dominated by two epics: the session-history-remediation program's opening wave, and a
parallel hook-hot-path de-monolithization effort.

### Session-history-remediation program: launch (epics 1, 3, 5, 17)

The epic `bd-session-history-remediation-ocv9i` was scoped directly from a review of real
agent session logs, targeting the failure modes showing up in the wild: workers stuck in a
manual-recovery bypass state, hooks that couldn't self-heal a dead daemon socket,
silently-ignored placement env vars, and unredacted secrets in proof output.

#### Delivered capability

- Bypass recovery service: a probe/backoff/canary auto-rejoin loop so a worker temporarily bypassed for a failure no longer needs a manual `rch workers enable` to recover (epic 1.3).
- Hook socket-failure recovery: structured incidents plus autostart hardening when the daemon socket is unreachable (epic 3.1).
- Agent-facing proof handoff output format (epic 5.4), and a canonical placement-controls registry (`rch-common/src/placement.rs`) resolving `RCH_WORKER`, `RCH_FORCE_REMOTE`/`RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE`, `RCH_QUEUE_WHEN_BUSY`, `RCH_VISIBILITY` and their aliases into a `PlacementPlan` that never silently drops an unrecognized or superseded knob — fixing a previously **silently-ignored `RCH_FORCE_REMOTE`** (epic 13.5).
- Central remediation config schema + default policy, wired into `init`/`doctor`/`lint`/`diff`/`export` rollout, with E2E golden-test coverage (epic 17.1–17.3).
- `redact_secrets` wired into every remediation output surface plus shell E2E leak guards (`bd-53ga7`).
- `rch sync --force` — an agent-safe force-resync command (`bd-apg5l`).
- `rch capabilities` webhook notifications fire on reliability-verdict transitions.

### Hook hot-path de-monolithization (epic zcecy.14)

`remote_compilation_helper-zcecy` began carving `rch/src/hook.rs` into focused submodules
(29 commits reference `zcecy` in this range). This release extracts the SSH command runner,
command-parsing, formatting, and repo-updater pre-sync subsystems; the effort completes in
v1.0.45.

### Fleet reliability and scheduler correctness

A cluster of independent fixes targeting worker dispatch and connection health, several from
a dedicated fleet audit.

#### Delivered capability

- Self-healing circuit window + first-class worker priority (#21): `CircuitStats::error_rate()` computes over a bounded recent-results window instead of unbounded lifetime counters, and `close()` clears `recent_results` — fixes long-uptime daemons silently dropping healthy workers from dispatch (the recurring "not enough free build slots" flapping). Priority becomes a first-class selection input.
- `SshPool` validates connection liveness on borrow instead of trusting a possibly-dead pooled connection.
- Remote target-dir reuse + narrowed sync-back (#19): the remote cargo target-dir name is a stable key derived from `(project_root, toolchain, target)` instead of unique-per-invocation, so builds stop cold-recompiling the full dependency graph and leaving GBs of throwaway per-job target dirs; sync-back fails loud on missing artifacts.
- Watchdog stdio detach (#20): a successful build releases its SSH session immediately instead of holding it open.
- Fleet deploy guards against OS/arch binary mismatch, so a mismatched worker binary is refused rather than bricking the target.
- `cache_gc` staging walk never follows symlinks; `rch-wkr` status messages use a non-panicking stderr write.
- Hot-path performance budgets + regression suite (epic 16.7).
- CI nightly toolchain pin bumped 2025-11-01 → 2026-06-06 (#22), fixing an `ftui-widgets` E0658 that had blocked all builds/releases off `main`.

## [v1.0.41] -- 2026-06-08 (release)

### Added

- **Autonomous worker-side stale-target reaper (default-OFF).** `rchd` gains an
  optional periodic background sweep that SSHes each healthy worker every
  `interval_mins` (default 120) and reaps abandoned per-job `.rch-target-*-job-*`
  / `.rch-target-*-pid-*` dirs idle >`idle_hours` (default 12h) across **all**
  repos under the worker's canonical project root — closing the gap where the
  orchestrator hook only ever reaps the single repo currently being built (the
  ~1.6 TB-across-the-fleet accumulation). Shares one predicate with the hook
  reaper (`rch_common::stale_target_reap`) so the two cannot drift. Depth-robust
  (`find -maxdepth 8 -prune`, catches nested workspace members), canonicalizes a
  symlinked base, and re-asserts a ≥2-path-segment guard on the resolved root.
  **Ships default-OFF** (this is an autonomous periodic deleter targeting
  `/data/projects`); enable per-host with `RCH_WORKER_REAP_ENABLE=1` or
  `[stale_target_reap] enabled = true`, disable with `RCH_WORKER_REAP_DISABLE=1`.

### Changed

- **Orchestrator hook reaper reverted to cheap current-project-only.** With the
  daemon now handling cross-repo GC, the hook reaper no longer does a full
  `find` over the canonical root on every build dispatch (the v1.0.38/39
  behavior) — it again sweeps only the just-built repo's sibling per-job dirs via
  a `cd`-based glob (which also follows a symlinked project dir natively). This
  removes the per-dispatch full-tree walk.

### Fixes

- **`rch daemon restart` now cycles a systemd-managed rchd.** On hosts where
  rchd runs as a systemd `--user` (or system) unit, the old socket-shutdown +
  spawn path could not restart the unit (systemd respawned the old on-disk
  image; the manual spawn deferred to systemd and exited), leaving a stale
  binary running. `rch daemon restart` now detects a systemd-managed rchd and
  restarts via `systemctl [--user] restart rchd`, falling back to the manual
  path for user-launched daemons and macOS launchd.
- **`rch update` retries transient download/checksum failures.** GitHub
  `502/503/504`/`429` and request timeouts on the release asset or its `.sha256`
  sidecar are now retried with bounded backoff (4 attempts, 2s/5s/15s) instead
  of aborting (the "Checksum not found" symptom was a 504 on the sidecar). A
  genuine checksum **mismatch** (corruption) and a `404` (asset absent) remain
  hard failures.

---

## [v1.0.40] -- 2026-06-08 (release)

### Fixes

- **`rch exec` reaps the whole test process group at the runtime cap.** Killing
  only the direct child left grandchildren (test servers, fixtures) orphaned —
  observed as 20-45h orphan trees pinning worker resources. The cap now reaps the
  entire process group. (Also tightens `rchd` cache-cleanup and cancellation
  handling.)

---

## [v1.0.39] -- 2026-06-08 (release)

### Fixes

- **Stale-target reaper now works when the canonical root is a symlink on the
  worker.** v1.0.38 rooted the sweep at the orchestrator's `canonical_root`, but
  on a real worker that path is frequently a symlink (the macOS orchestrator
  passes `/Users/<u>/projects`, which is a symlink to `/data/projects` on the
  worker) and `find <symlink>` does not descend the target without `-L`. The
  reaper was therefore a silent no-op for builds dispatched from such an
  orchestrator (found by live canary testing). The generated reap script now
  canonicalizes the root and the live-dir path at runtime (`cd … && pwd -P`)
  before walking, so `find` traverses the real tree and the live-dir exclusion
  still matches the physical paths `find` emits. `-L` is deliberately *not* used
  (following arbitrary in-tree symlinks during a root-owned delete sweep is
  unsafe). A defense-in-depth check re-asserts the ≥2-path-segment invariant on
  the *resolved* root before any `find`/`rm`.

---

## [v1.0.38] -- 2026-06-08 (release)

### Fixes

- **Stale-target reaper now sweeps every project under the canonical root.**
  The reaper (added in v1.0.34) only ever swept the *current* build's project
  directory, so once a project stopped dispatching builds its abandoned per-job
  `.rch-target-<host>-job-*` dirs were never revisited and accumulated forever
  (observed: 72 dirs / 332G on a single worker). It now roots its sweep at the
  same `canonical_root` (`/data/projects`) where per-job dirs are actually
  created, using a depth-robust `find -maxdepth 8 -type d -name
  '.rch-target-*-job-*' -o -name '.rch-target-*-pid-*' -prune` that matches
  top-level repos, canonical `<id>/<hash>` layouts, and nested workspace members
  alike (the old fixed-depth `*/*/` glob silently missed both 1-level and
  3+-level dirs). The `is_safe_reap_path` guard, the >12h newest-descendant idle
  check (no `-type f`, so a freshly `mkdir`'d concurrent build survives — the
  v1.0.35 race fix), and full-path exclusion of the live job dir are all
  preserved; the live dir is excluded by exact path and a fresh project's dirs
  are protected by the idle check.

- **Isolated CARGO_HOME staging honors `TMPDIR`.** Per-job cargo-home dirs were
  hardcoded under `/tmp` (`/tmp/rch-cargo-home-*`), which eats RAM on workers
  with a tmpfs `/tmp`. The base is now resolved on the worker at execution time
  to `$TMPDIR` (if a real directory) → `/data/tmp` (if present) → `/tmp`. The
  `rch-cargo-home-` basename prefix is unchanged so external cleanup (sbh) still
  matches, and the resolution is done in shell with all values double-quoted, so
  a hostile `$TMPDIR` cannot inject. (rchd under systemd does not inherit PAM's
  `/etc/environment`, so the resolution is explicit rather than relying on the
  daemon's inherited env.)

---

## [v1.0.37] -- 2026-06-02 (release)

### Fixes

- **rchd: enforce a single instance via systemd cgroup detection** to stop
  orphan/duplicate daemons (no-op on macOS / non-unit hosts).

---

## [v1.0.36] -- 2026-06-02 (release)

### Fixes

- **rch-common: pin a finite ControlPersist** to stop the SSH control-master
  leak (leaked masters + telemetry gap). Corrects the `control_persist_idle`
  documentation accordingly.

---

## [v1.0.35] -- 2026-05-30 (release)

### Fixes

- **Stale-target reaper: don't reap a just-created sibling.** The reaper's
  recency check used `find -type f`, which finds nothing in a per-job dir that
  a *concurrent* build has just `mkdir`'d but not yet written a file into — so it
  could delete an active build's target dir (the build then fails and must
  retry). The check now considers the directory itself and any descendant
  (`find <dir> -mmin -N`), so a freshly-created dir is kept by its own recent
  mtime while genuinely-abandoned dirs are still reaped. Also corrected the
  reaper's doc comments (it does not assert per-job dirs are "reused", and the
  call awaits a quick SSH dispatch rather than adding zero latency).

---

## [v1.0.34] -- 2026-05-30 (release)

### Worker disk hygiene

- **Reap abandoned per-job remote target directories.** Forwarded-`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`
  builds get a per-job target dir on the worker
  (`.rch-target-<worker>-job-<id>-<ts>-<seq>`) that rch previously never cleaned
  up, so they accumulated until worker disks filled (observed on a worker whose
  single btrfs root hit 100% from ~600G of stale per-job dirs). After each sync,
  rch now opportunistically removes sibling per-job dirs on the chosen worker
  whose **newest file is older than an idle threshold** (default **12h**,
  overridable via `RCH_STALE_TARGET_REAP_HOURS`, floored at 1h). Because per-job
  dirs are *reused* across an agent's edit-compile-fix loop, the reaper keys on
  recent file activity so an in-progress incremental cache is always preserved —
  it never clips a live build or races a concurrent build on the same project,
  even with multiple agents building it on the same worker. The removal is
  detached on the worker and best-effort, so it adds no latency to the build.
  Inputs are charset-guarded before being embedded in the remote reap script.

---

## [v1.0.33] -- 2026-05-29 (release)

### Restart-storm eradication and release-pipeline unblocking

A systemd interaction bug had been silently restart-storming rchd on four Linux controllers
(28k–34k restarts observed) while flooding the Mac controller's log capture at 2.1 GB/day,
and in parallel the GitHub Actions release workflow had been failing for three consecutive
tag attempts (v1.0.29–v1.0.31 all 24h-timed-out). This version fixes both the daemon-level
bug and the CI pipeline that ships it.

#### Delivered capability

- `rchd::bind_daemon_socket` waits for the current socket owner to free it under systemd (`INVOCATION_ID` set) instead of exiting 1 and triggering `Restart=always` storms; standalone invocations keep fail-fast behavior.
- `rch::doctor::spawn_rchd` self-heal prefers `systemctl --user start rchd.service` (idempotent) over nohup-spawning a competing detached daemon that could permanently seize the socket.
- Telemetry poller's per-worker SSH connect/disconnect lines demoted from INFO to `debug!`, plus a log retention cap (`RCH_LOG_MAX_FILES`, default 7) — ends the 8.3M-line/day log flood.
- `sd_notify` (`Type=notify` readiness, `READY=1` + `STATUS=`) so `systemctl status` shows why a waiting rchd looks idle; `wait_for_socket` probes for a live listener instead of stat-ing the path.
- CI: pinned `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` (the "can't find crate for `core`" failure that had silently broken every release build since v1.0.29), patched `/dp/` path deps on SIP-protected macOS runners, and dropped the broken Windows build and the runner-starved macOS x86_64 job from `publish.needs`.

#### Representative commits

- [`23c2e40e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/23c2e40e) systemd wait-for-owner + prefer `systemctl start` over nohup-spawn; INFO→debug log demotion + retention cap
- [`96aeb2cb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/96aeb2cb) retry on transient bind errors; testable `bind_daemon_socket_with_mode` split
- [`31ab11e3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/31ab11e3) `sd_notify` readiness + `wait_for_socket` probes a live listener
- [`9349e275`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9349e275) pin `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` — fixes the stdlib-shadowing bug behind three timed-out releases
- [`e3b45d4d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e3b45d4d) drop the broken Windows build and runner-starved macOS x86_64 from `publish.needs`

There is no `v1.0.32` tag.

## [v1.0.31] -- 2026-05-26 (release)

One-commit tuning fix closing the telemetry-poller saga (see v1.0.28–v1.0.30): v1.0.30 made
every poll cycle refresh all workers, but freshness reads still dipped because
`skip_after=60s` plus a 30 s tick pushed the effective re-poll interval to ~90 s — exactly
the pressure layer's telemetry-stale threshold, so workers raced in and out of "fresh".
[`848e0539`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/848e0539)
drops `skip_after` to 30 s (effective ~60 s re-poll).

## [v1.0.30] -- 2026-05-26 (release)

One-commit fix making the telemetry poller resilient to SSH contention: fleet telemetry
freshness fluctuated because concurrent SSH load from other daemon subsystems caused
intermittent re-poll failures.
[`3e483741`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3e483741)
adds a one-shot retry with backoff per poll attempt, a per-cycle INFO-level "refreshed N/M"
summary, and `MissedTickBehavior::Skip` so a long cycle cannot fire a burst of back-to-back
cycles. Validated 8/8 workers refreshed with 0 failures over ~4.5 minutes.

## [v1.0.29] -- 2026-05-26 (release)

One-commit fix for permit starvation introduced by v1.0.28's semaphore: a poll whose SSH
hung past the (not-always-honored) `ssh_timeout` held its concurrency permit indefinitely;
on a 9-worker fleet ~4 stuck polls exhausted all 4 permits and silently collapsed freshness
to 1/9 workers.
[`f1d07625`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/f1d07625)
wraps each poll in a hard `tokio::time::timeout(ssh_timeout + 5s)` and raises
`MAX_CONCURRENT_TELEMETRY_POLLS` 4 → 16.

## [v1.0.28] -- 2026-05-26 (release)

One-commit fix for the telemetry poller starving worker selection: the poller held a
`worker.config` read-lock across the entire SSH round-trip and fanned out one unbounded poll
per worker per tick, producing multi-second "worker_selection latency exceeded panic
threshold" stalls (5–20 s against a 50 ms budget).
[`ab23b1ef`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ab23b1ef)
snapshots the worker config and releases the lock before SSH work, and bounds concurrent SSH
polls with a 4-permit semaphore.

## [v1.0.27] -- 2026-05-25 (release)

### Fleet-reliability hardening and worker-topology correctness

57 commits (2026-05-15 → 05-19) closing three parallel workstreams: canonical
worker-filesystem-topology validation, the reliability/telemetry reporting pipeline that
later fed the v1.0.28–v1.0.31 poller fixes, and a security-hardening pass across
shell-command construction sites. Also delivers the `RCH_*_INJECT_*` test-fixture registry
and two new `rch doctor`/`rch workers` subcommands.

#### Delivered capability

- `path_topology` alias verification widened to accept `AliasSubtreeSymlinkVerified` (alias points at a subtree of the canonical root) and `AliasDirectoryEntryVerified` (alias is a real directory containing symlinks into the canonical root), plus hook fail-closed behavior and a worker-probe refactor.
- `rch doctor --runbook <code>` and `--runbook-list`: static Markdown incident runbooks per `RCH-Rnnn` reliability code.
- `rch workers benchmark [WORKER_ID] [--all] [--force]` and `rch workers compare`, completing the SpeedScore display/management commands.
- `RCH_*_INJECT_*` env-var registry (`rch-common/src/testing/injection.rs`): one source of truth for debug/test injection variables, so a typo becomes a compile error instead of a silent no-op.
- Reliability-pipeline correctness: admission verdicts wired into pressure debt, side-effect-free reliability scoring, command exits excluded from worker circuit health, selector-rejection diagnostics surfaced, affinity fallback requires slots, rchd reports only assignable free slots.
- Remediation-reporting fixes: correct `telemetry_gap` fix strings across `rch check`/`rch status`/RCH-R104 (issue #16 — none of the three prior directives actually refreshed telemetry).
- Security hardening across worker-deploy shell commands, hook settings mutation, queue-display/test-log paths, topology/transfer/selector diagnostics quoting, rsync filter escaping, and catch-all-artifact source guards.
- Update/lock hardening: tokenized lock-file parsing; the lock file is only removed on `Drop` if its body still matches what the guard wrote.
- Docs: `SKILL.md`/`HOOKS.md`/`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`/`WORKERS.md` rewritten around `rch doctor` as the entry point; `diagnose-rch.sh` removed.

## [v1.0.26] -- 2026-05-14 (release)

Same-day one-commit follow-up to v1.0.25:
[`25848a02`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/25848a02)
adds an `upgrade` alias for the release/upgrade helper.

## [v1.0.25] -- 2026-05-14 (release)

### Dependency and release maintenance

- Switched local-owner libraries to the current `/dp` checkouts: FrankenTUI
  crates now resolve from `/dp/frankentui`, TOON resolves from
  `/dp/toon_rust`, and `rich_rust` resolves from `/dp/rich_rust`.
- Refreshed Rust direct dependencies and lockfile, including `reqwest`,
  `sha2`, `hmac`, `rusqlite`, `proptest`, `insta`, `terminal_size`,
  `whoami`, `fastrand`, and security-sensitive transitive TLS crates.
- Removed the `rich_rust/full` feature from RCH's default rich UI path,
  dropping unmaintained `syntect` transitive dependencies that were not
  needed by the codebase.
- Updated the web dashboard dependency stack to current compatible releases
  and added a `postcss` override so `npm audit` remains clean while Next.js
  ships its pinned nested dependency.
- Hardened the release workflow so all release and publish jobs recreate the
  `/dp` local dependency layout, including Windows builds and crates.io dry
  runs.

## [v1.0.24] -- 2026-04-29 (release)

Single-commit release.
[`ce4b0029`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ce4b0029)
fixes `find_local_binary()` in `rch/src/fleet/mod.rs` so `rch fleet deploy` prefers a
properly installed `rch-wkr` (resolved via `which`, home dir, or the current-exe directory)
over whatever happens to sit in a dev `target/{release,debug}` or `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, so a
stale or mismatched dev build no longer gets pushed to fleet workers. The commit also
carries an incidental `.beads/issues.jsonl` id-format normalization — a tracker-sync side
effect, not a product change.

## [v1.0.23] -- 2026-04-29 (release)

Three-commit release closing out the day's deploy-hardening push.

- [`8fdd6d06`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8fdd6d06) `rch doctor` no longer panics on a broken pipe: stdout writes go through a `write_stdout` wrapper so piping the report into `head` is normal Unix behavior instead of a crash.
- [`72bcbfd3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/72bcbfd3) `copy_binary_via_scp` uploads to a per-deploy staging path and renames into place instead of SCP-ing straight onto `~/.local/bin/rch-wkr` — a direct overwrite could fail or corrupt the binary while the worker was executing it.
- [`bca70f48`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/bca70f48) `install.sh` installs binaries via `install -m 755` into `${dest}.tmp.$$` then `mv -f`, so re-running the installer against a live `rchd`/`rch-wkr` doesn't `ETXTBSY` or truncate a running executable.

## [v1.0.22] -- 2026-04-29 (release)

- [`83606e72`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/83606e72) `send_daemon_command` gains a 3 s connect timeout and 10 s I/O timeout plus explicit half-close around the daemon Unix-socket protocol, so a CLI invocation can no longer hang indefinitely if `rchd` never responds.
- [`17eaeacc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/17eaeacc) release workflow concurrency group scoped per-tag instead of one global `release` group (a stale queued run for one tag could block every subsequent release); the `cargo publish -p rch-common` step checks crates.io directly for an already-published version.
- [`8a036ead`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8a036ead) version bump.

## [v1.0.21] -- 2026-04-29 (release)

Two commits: a version bump plus
[`f71aa7d3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/f71aa7d3),
which adds `--safe-links` to the new `build_retrieve_streaming_command()` rsync invocation so
streamed artifact retrieval preserves the symlink-safety semantics the streaming path had
dropped relative to the non-streaming command.

## [v1.0.20] -- 2026-04-29 (release)

### CARGO_TARGET_DIR round-tripping and installer resilience

Two problems surfaced from real remote-build usage: `rch exec` silently dropped custom Cargo
target directories when running builds on a worker, and the installer had a hardcoded
`/tmp/rch` runtime directory that could collide with a stale non-directory left behind by
another tool.

#### Delivered capability

- `rch exec` maps a local `--target-dir`/`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to a worker-scoped `.rch-target`, strips the local target-dir setting before shipping the command remotely, and syncs `.rch-target` back to the requested local path on completion — so two projects with different target dirs no longer clobber each other's artifacts on the same worker.
- `[path_topology]` TOML config is wired end-to-end: `PartialRchConfig` gained the field (serde had silently dropped the whole section), `apply_layer` merges it, and `rch config get/show/validate` recognize the keys (closes #10). Two follow-ups make empty-string handling consistent (`RCH_CANONICAL_PROJECT_ROOT=""` is "unset" in `rch config get/show` and in `merge_config`).
- `install.sh` accepts a custom runtime directory and recovers instead of aborting when `/tmp/rch` already exists as a non-directory.

#### Representative commits

- [`13bc7498`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/13bc7498) CARGO_TARGET_DIR sync: worker-scoped `.rch-target` mapping, strip-then-restore around remote exec
- [`41eb319c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/41eb319c) gates the target-dir sync on cargo command kind
- [`62a823d2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/62a823d2) wires `path_topology` through the TOML parser and `rch config` (closes #10)

- [`be12fde1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/be12fde1) installer survives a `/tmp/rch` path collision

## [v1.0.19] -- 2026-04-23 (release)

### Audit-pass hardening sweep

40 commits, almost entirely from a self-directed correctness/safety audit plus five
new-capability beads closed the same evening (2026-04-22). The audit fixes share a pattern —
subtle concurrency races, unsafe string/byte slicing, permissive matchers, and resource
leaks that had shipped quietly and would only surface under load or on specific platforms.
The fleet-lock bug was traced to "Worker self-test failed" errors recurring across 30+
concurrent-agent sessions.

#### Delivered capability

- Structured error codes on worker probes: `WorkerProbeResult` gained `error_code` mapped from the RCH-Exxx catalog, plumbed through the probe path and surfaced in summaries, plus an interactive-TTY hint when `rch` is invoked bare.
- Per-fleet cooperative lock: `rch fleet {deploy,rollback,drain}` take a per-fleet lock, closing a race where two concurrent invocations (e.g. separate agent panes) could interleave systemd unit writes, binary swaps, and drain/undrain sequencing.
- Alert lifecycle + cleared-retention window: circuit-breaker alerts that self-heal no longer stay pinned on `rch status` indefinitely.
- Config diagnostics + `identity_file` env expansion: `rch workers list`/config validation aggregate missing-key diagnostics and expand env vars in `identity_file`, so a typo'd key path is caught at config time instead of at first probe failure.
- Self-test outer timeout budget: `rch self-test --all` enforces a real per-worker total timeout; previously a worker failing 3 retries could consume `3 × timeout + 2 × retry_delay` before being classified as timed out.
- Concurrency and resource-leak fixes: atomic rate-limit check+insert in `BenchmarkQueue::enqueue`; `kill_on_drop` + concurrent pipe drain on every timeout-wrapped subprocess spawn (fixing a >64 KB `cargo metadata` deadlock and a leaked-child bug); single `write_all` per line for concurrent O_APPEND JSONL writers; `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` lock acquisition for the update lock; `saturating_duration_since` replacing `Instant::now() - window` to stop a fresh-boot panic.
- Safety/correctness: shell-safe argv reassembly via `shell_words::join` for `rch exec -- …`; reject unsafe worker IDs and shell-escape IDs in remote commands; refuse slot reservations on draining/drained/disabled workers; clamp Rolling `batch_size`/AllAtOnce parallelism to avoid divide-by-zero; anchored/basename matchers replace three permissive substring matchers; no byte-indexed string slicing in display/parse paths; anchored `cleanup_old_backups` prefix matching; whole-disk vs partition classification across Linux naming schemes; true-median on even-length latency samples and a benchmark-score scaling no-op.

## [v1.0.18] -- 2026-04-16 (tag only)

### Diagnose + path topology bug fixes

- `rch diagnose` and the `rch exec` post-hook entry point now honor the
  configured `[path_topology]` section when normalizing the project path.
  Previously both call sites used the compiled-in `/data/projects` + `/dp`
  defaults even when operators had set `canonical_root` / `alias_root` in
  `config.toml`, producing a spurious warning:
  `Project path normalization failed for ...: canonical root is missing
  (input: ..., detail: missing root /data/projects)`. Closes
  [#9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/issues/9).

## [v1.0.17] -- 2026-04-01 (release)

Nightly toolchain verification release. Unpins the nightly toolchain to the
rolling latest, forwards `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` through delegated commands,
expands path-dependency resolution to enclosing workspace roots, and switches
documentation examples to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` instead of hardcoded `/tmp`.

---

## [v1.0.16] -- 2026-03-23 **(release)**

### Worker scheduling safety

- Prevent concurrent builds for the same project from landing on the same worker checkout. The daemon now excludes workers already active for that project and uses an atomic active-build claim after slot reservation to close the last same-project race in worker selection. ([fbea95f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/fbea95f7b65903859a3e81f7f01d9ced28ac7ee2))

### Dependency maintenance

- Update dependencies to resolve security advisories. ([1548842](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/154884291146b73177c122e1856c0d287767ef50))

### Configurable path topology

- New `[path_topology]` config section allows operators to define custom project root directories instead of hardcoded `/data/projects` and `/dp` conventions. All project-hash call sites now respect the configured policy. ([87b8bc6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/87b8bc6cdce9036b3f61877c9bffdb2b4e413eaa), [a04737f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a04737f7a1a78c0eafe76feb0bfcf386d9dc34aa))

### Hook system expansion

- Major expansion of the hook lifecycle: additional compilation event handling, improved orchestration, and expanded compilation config types in the transfer pipeline. ([698422c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/698422cbe71ab0a2fcaf9720e6abe6b0ab3a532e), [a92c452](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a92c4528d730d24765d009db3e6f59f0c0987b02), [eb516a4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/eb516a4a299ce772c3f0c19b6e02a13f52c1d203), [aed2477](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/aed247792bda9e83c33d8f75a5ccba8181b5635c), [e713602](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e7136026e69cfe85905dc189d87dc2bb97f3ff86))

Metadata-only release bumping the release tag to match v1.0.12 content.

- Release v1.0.13 ([e69e0e2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e69e0e2c921961046a787cf21013f76e772c3a98))

---

## [v1.0.12] -- 2026-03-18 **(release)**

### Worker selection and scheduling

- Priority-based worker selection with cache affinity and speed-score tiebreakers; improved cache tracker to better reflect per-project build locality. ([9b2106b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9b2106be68c57b9d4064850bc341393e8954caa9))

### Remote process lifecycle

- Remote process group cleanup via PGID file so orphan build processes on workers are reliably reaped. Cancellation and history refinements accompany the change. ([ea86c25](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ea86c2573e322c961fc4972e6f473d6710bdc4d8))

### Compilation configuration

- Exposed compilation slot and timeout config fields (`build_slots`, `test_slots`, `check_slots`, `build_timeout_sec`, `test_timeout_sec`, `bun_timeout_sec`) and wired them through the remote execution pipeline so operators can tune concurrency per build type. ([3a65c86](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3a65c86c4c35d27aed96f5f36d315095a3bf9306))

---

## [v1.0.11] -- 2026-03-17 **(release)**

Large release spanning the full reliability subsystem, TUI migration, and many operational improvements.

### Reliability subsystem (bd-vvmd epic)

#### Repo convergence service

- New `RepoConvergence` service tracks which repositories each worker has, detects drift from the required dependency graph, and provides operator commands (`status`, `dry-run`, `repair`). A background periodic convergence loop alerts on drift automatically. Convergence checks are integrated into worker selection so builds avoid workers missing required repos. ([b51d1ed](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b51d1ed769c8c91a1c56128c45e9c2194016fcfd), [a876f0c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a876f0c7b560959ac7755cba31b8809c25a5f1b9), [db0728d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/db0728d160ac8022d60c6c2837045f80cd7af5f5), [c8fe9bf](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c8fe9bf7443f1906b31ce0f8e50c058fbaf01418))

#### Disk pressure resilience

- Disk pressure module scores worker storage health, integrates into daemon lifecycle, worker selection, and status reporting. Predictive headroom estimator and reservation model prevent scheduling builds that would fill a disk. Safe reclaim module protects active builds while reclaiming space with bounded budgets. Scheduler admission control rejects builds when pressure is too high. 32 integration tests cover disk-full prevention and recovery. ([660e7a4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/660e7a406973a07023786e4b85d0536c6f07a633), [ea3ba1a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ea3ba1a120a24fb6c2b421d530bfb6d5d72eb791), [320780d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/320780d0f59520dfdd9b8326e3d161eb740774a8), [6bae14b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6bae14b6d09dbd319c02c77f5a691045938c2233), [fcfe4e8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/fcfe4e82f01ea66ea79561b03e67780f8b3e13ec))

#### Process triage and remediation

- Bounded remediation pipeline with TERM/KILL escalation and full audit trail. Periodic triage loop and on-demand triage command for operator intervention. ([b70e4e7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b70e4e7bc643fd1d4a78cfc1a3108a531e3ec49d), [a770153](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a770153cecdd2d1e7f86b29c853af19cca8f8c1b))

#### Unified reliability model

- Multi-signal reliability model unifies health, convergence, pressure, and triage data into a single worker health score used by the scheduler. ([3c55240](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3c55240cec81e30bded7196ba7fa7cfd91293a0a))

#### Cancellation orchestration

- `CancellationOrchestrator` with deterministic state machine and bounded escalation. Cancellation metadata wired into build history, daemon status API, doctor, TUI, and status display. E2E cancellation test scripts added. ([38260cd](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/38260cd359789c50fe2bf528cd848f0a1b4c52d2), [882545e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/882545ea6d2a08455b2eea3b9826100d428d7387), [1b54521](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/1b54521f56a0899e9cd3d692753bfdd0688cbb3d))

#### Dependency closure planner

- Builds can now include required repository closure (transitive path dependencies) rather than syncing a single root. Cargo metadata timeout and binary hash hardening also added. ([8363b75](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8363b75ed0a2c10b9876943c1b281bd09b2d97be), [2815b6d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2815b6d19f593880db031a3cb1198c75d6fc4b6e), [d6590d1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d6590d16ec0272834c1951bd79abbcaf244dfa38))

### Unified status and posture

- Unified status overview surfaces system posture, convergence state, pressure, and actionable remediation hints in a single view. Error code taxonomy extended with 28 new codes for path-deps, closure, storage, and process-triage. ([ddd0bec](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ddd0becbef253ed938439381439a38c39ca04063), [b571053](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b571053b44a6f60bb67ed9f791ebe5edd3f6aa56))

### TUI migration to FrankenTUI

- Terminal UI layer migrated from ratatui/crossterm to FrankenTUI native stack, including workspace dependency updates. Buffer rendering fix for empty cells and frame rect origin normalization. ([365f607](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/365f6072e16c72d487d3b1c833b8dd5d187b1d75), [e68db7d](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/e68db7d27f25f389d8a6979db67dfcf99f0a57be), [86cd921](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/86cd921b41755091039ec3a1a004e061eeeacd74))

### Command classification and shell safety

- Shell-aware command tokenizer, classification regression tests, and timing budget assertions ensure the 5-tier classifier remains fast and accurate. Output truncation with SIGPIPE prevention added for large build outputs. ([1b867f1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/1b867f12d88c3e9196c88c2f813781a22262064d), [2ff8c3c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2ff8c3c2c9007e45f2a72e7ea0e6cf85f171aefd), [78d2f9f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/78d2f9fcc96edc7577bf0626c3e2e5443ff10070))

### Hook and daemon improvements

- Dynamic daemon timeout with queue-aware behavior. Hook skips `repo_updater` pre-sync when local sync roots are dirty. Worker disk space probed from project root instead of `/tmp`. Concurrent agent updates to hook timeout logic handled safely. ([202a3d9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/202a3d9fa86001f573de32857ecb233ec39bdd9c), [720f980](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/720f9804aa06ad0959009984955ab371e7e8233b), [4f4f01e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/4f4f01ea8bea7e6522bb108326989f9d76b58002))

### SSH and transfer

- SSH ControlMaster defaulted to off with fallback retry, fixing alias-based path topology issues. Broken pipe errors from protocol deadlock eliminated. Portable builds enabled by replacing local frankentui path deps with git deps. ([464a25b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/464a25bef50df62e8ef324b946b7585b0499ed11), [fdcab48](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/fdcab4834114e35a508d7206b9102906a1e2ee77), [ef566dd](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ef566ddc86b62e241aba0a09da73dc0d6894b6b2))

### Worker tooling

- `rch-wkr benchmark` now supports `--json` and `--format` output flags. ([a2ac6b3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a2ac6b30acefb3963380dd71d4eef4f078be8b2e))

### Cargo path dependency detection

- Hook detects cargo path dependencies and expands the transfer set accordingly. Common-library logic simplified. ([286b138](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/286b138c4d76c4af74815e492ea6b0983df3d925), [68f6434](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/68f6434c168015e99a3daafbde56190e16c7ae52))

### Build lifecycle hooks

- Pre/post build lifecycle callbacks in the hook system and false toolchain fallback avoidance. ([d91d967](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d91d96759d9c03a3766e97c389c0c0cfdb2be9fa), [9996a37](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/9996a37b8db5eb328b1926f2bc3048434ece123c))

### Security and correctness

- Sensitive value masking handles quoted strings. User-isolated cache directory. 24-hour hard timeout for stuck builds. Epoch-based build IDs for uniqueness. Double slot release prevention. ([3fb98ce](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/3fb98ce393a146629dcef938e12f629b833d7546), [4cc9f7e](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/4cc9f7e6f719a72d31f8e11abf2294893cde8738), [08ae6e7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/08ae6e7202bc10872f06f1dac68e209ea8be1bec))

### Testing

- 15-file comprehensive reliability E2E test suite, schema contract E2E tests, Criterion microbenchmarks for the reliability pipeline, and operator runbook. Test suites for path deps, convergence, triage, and fault injection. ([77074ba](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/77074ba7a6da582a4198b407e1572c610c8ee1a2), [7aefab2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/7aefab26551a915d8bd6861c2547e53e33b628bc), [95c8e80](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/95c8e808446aa070e40ca08748f69184d7585f69), [2498cb9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2498cb9a826e7794a68d064a5de417df1e579c1a))

---

## [v1.0.2] -- 2026-02-02 **(release)**

### Transparent command interception

- `AllowWithModifiedCommand` hook response enables transparent interception: the hook rewrites the command the agent sees so remote execution is invisible to the caller. ([cfdb411](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/cfdb4115bf327827312f649027a291360db26f4f))

---

## [v1.0.1] -- 2026-02-01 **(release)**

### Daemon robustness

- Improved daemon robustness with timeouts, logging, and cache bounds. Timeouts and body size limits added to hook-daemon communication. Robust drift detection in benchmark scheduler. ([14d955a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/14d955a80bc1eb19e53e3279fc9504e83eaaa188), [8141d20](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8141d20523c238ebb14585490ee315995e5fff33), [c7a4e45](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c7a4e45e876481376916be6a70f5d2657866995e))

### Cross-platform compatibility

CI matrix refined for platform-appropriate crate exclusions. ([0b15482](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0b154821ad860a496933859cd458c0d68bd76f84), [adad172](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/adad172eb44489e4fdf80fd3a23027fb16e1e9ef), [410713c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/410713c082ea44db49e4f50cad392aee1d8fa4e6))

### Refactoring and code quality

- Worker handler functions extracted from `api.rs` to `workers.rs`. Dead code from old multi-pass classifier removed (replaced by single-pass state machine). Deep audit fixes for security, reliability, and performance. Strict Sigstore certificate verification enforced for updates. `bail!()` calls converted to structured error types throughout. ([b579b20](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/b579b20cc49e608a20ea9d4befc9bb064fd4e556), [a806111](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a806111ece977aab5c6912c403899d2ebf63bea6), [2886ce1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2886ce1de6110ad8ad0255558767cff0d9e1cf3b), [a6ea157](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/a6ea157a2c9f1ab3c22e5604d263a6fcfff2f7d3))

Parallel rollback operations with graceful worker lifecycle. `SshExecutor` for shared fleet SSH infrastructure. Fleet status probes with async telemetry. Comprehensive E2E fleet test scripts. ([54fde73](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/54fde7334a0f52539683ebbf55913d2708cbda3c), [77174578](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/77174578d9477654e1c544129f2c212fc4ef7d7e), [8ce42a3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/8ce42a342d94fc3ccbae2bef0962fb686b7e3f13), [ab7a83c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/ab7a83c5e47dccb905ead7657ece48bd11706969))

### Installer resilience

- Installer auto-fallbacks to source build when prebuilt binaries are unavailable. Installer uses `cargo +nightly` instead of assuming default toolchain. TEMP_DIR leak fixed. Config doctor and config edit commands added. ([c7ffb48](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c7ffb48b92b4615ed6805a794b147f998a0f2c10), [76a82c8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/76a82c8e7e848f14171f8bd3d322e7fa303395b9), [0a5637b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0a5637b5a99c73e187435e26b33e7542337f6f7d))

### CLI modularization

- `commands.rs` split into module directory with dedicated files for daemon, config, workers, queue, agents, and speedscore commands. Command helpers consolidated. `-y`/`--yes` flags for non-interactive use. `config get` and `config set` commands implemented. ([dd9b366](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/dd9b366bbfcfd54eb9b890d6707891c52dd5d131), [943fedd](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/943fedd809d01edfdc5456f80e92c89694f60f17), [5fff22f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/5fff22f7ee9cfcc0c647c0b5747df68bb57334e2), [0f09429](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/0f694298f6fca460aac22b311af8a9dda129ccbc))

### Security

- Command injection prevention: commands with embedded newlines rejected. Update checksum verification enforced. Hook/daemon input limits hardened. Concurrent backup registry access protected with locks. ([553c064](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/553c06421e497b89f2065b70726d3085c6976a5f), [2caa631](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2caa6311aea71aee01302319b24cbc54ee055ca0), [2f9de73](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/2f9de73c94f97c1aa82b29df20e1a3188075ea1d), [c92f867](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c92f867499684bdcb6471c94b8340b9093997f3a))

### Performance

- `Classification` strings switched to `Cow<'static, str>` for zero-allocation hot paths. Timing estimation moved to `spawn_blocking`. Blocking IO moved off async thread in the hook. In-memory cache for `TimingHistory`. ([30503fe](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/30503fe5c38c6e403ee550a4d9c056f3860db952), [071f3d5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/071f3d5bbd90097f2464c6102039020af724deac), [90752e5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/90752e570a6343c658621f4d4ac7439189ccd827), [c4ebdbb](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/c4ebdbb905140dffb93f0f77e80958019da74231))

([27a7e78](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/27a7e7877798aec58d90fd5327a3816a4f7805f9), [6e014ee](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/6e014eeb86d08b494d1039e8bb9f34988a1e37e9))

### Worker improvements

- Worker selection, health checks, and API robustness refined. Cache affinity uniqueness improved via path hash. Cache age overflow prevented with `saturating_mul`. Preflight checks and transfer handling refined. ([d830790](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/d8307901f36e0f25c291692436693334ddd7b672), [16b7de3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/16b7de3f2a6e822d6e974e2e8f5f721a0250e005), [bd34757](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/remote_compilation_helper/commit/bd34757aa89442a35f926094586edaccabada8c7))

---

## Notes for Agents

- Start with the [Version Timeline](#version-timeline) for chronology and the release-vs-tag
  distinction; the installer and the fleet's nightly updater only ever serve **Releases**.
- Jump into a version section for what actually landed: `Delivered capability` names the
  behavior, `Closed workstreams` gives the intent (search `.beads/issues.jsonl` for the id),
  `Representative commits` are the diffs to read first.
- The two subsystems most worth knowing before touching code: the reliability/remediation
  stack (`v1.0.11` → `v1.0.45`, epics `bd-vvmd` and `bd-session-history-remediation-ocv9i`)
  and RABS (`v1.0.57` → `v1.0.58`, epics `remote_compilation_helper-rabs-root-4pidu.*`).
- Shim versions matter operationally: shim v2 (`v1.0.59`) and v3 (`v1.0.60`) both require
  `rch shim install` after upgrading; `rch shim status` reports staleness.
- Three tags are not what they look like: `v1.0.50` is an unpublished draft, `v1.0.58` has no
  release at all, and `v1.0.32`/`v1.0.48` were never cut.
- Everything below `v1.0.16` in the reference block uses compare links; newer versions link
  straight to their release or tag page in the timeline.
