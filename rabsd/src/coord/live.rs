//! The live coordinator state (bead S6 / bridge plan Phase S): the
//! first live mounts of the D024 [`TargetLeaseRegistry`], the D031
//! [`DestinationArbiter`], and a singleflight table keyed by the Epic F
//! action key. One binary, structural authority split (plan §10): the
//! edge routes every consult through THIS state in-process, and the
//! coord region owns its lifecycle.
//!
//! ## Shadow-tier singleflight window
//!
//! Production singleflight closes a flight when the action COMPLETES.
//! In shadow tier nothing completes through us — the wrapper execs the
//! compiler and its connection closes (fds are CLOEXEC). The flight
//! window is therefore CONNECTION-SCOPED: begin at consult, end when
//! the connection drops. Two overlapping consults for one key yield
//! exactly one leader and N followers, observable and receipted. (This
//! is also the design direction: a serving wrapper will hold its
//! connection through the compile, making the window the real one.)
//!
//! ## Degraded mode
//!
//! If the coord region is down (lab-injected today, crashed tomorrow),
//! edge consults DO NOT fail: they answer in the typed
//! `shadow-coord-degraded` mode — fail-open extends to the authority
//! split itself, and the shutdown receipt shows the coord region
//! abandoned so nothing hides.
