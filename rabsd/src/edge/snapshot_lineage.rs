//! Requested→resolved execution snapshot lineage for Cargo
//! fetch/resolution/lockfile mutation (bead D032; invariant I53; risk
//! R110).
//!
//! Cargo resolution MUTATES state (lockfile, config, source selection),
//! and a command that half-runs against pre-mutation state and half
//! against post-mutation state has no coherent identity at all. The
//! lineage state machine makes the boundary explicit:
//!
//! - resolution runs from the [`RequestedCommandSnapshot`] against a
//!   PRIVATE writable overlay (the requested snapshot never mutates);
//! - before the first resolution-dependent compile action the edge
//!   SEALS a [`ResolvedExecutionSnapshot`] generation;
//! - every fine-grained action names EXACTLY ONE sealed generation —
//!   registration returns that single reference or a typed refusal;
//! - post-seal mutation forces a RESEAL (new generation; already-run
//!   actions keep their old generation forever) or a coherent
//!   DOWNGRADE (no further sealed actions) — never a mixed state;
//! - generation numbers are never reused within a command, and a
//!   DOWNGRADE IS TERMINAL: neither sealing nor a later mutation can
//!   bring a downgraded command back to a sealed state (T041). Both
//!   rules exist because a downgrade clears the current generation, and
//!   anything that renumbered from it restarted at 1 while existing
//!   bindings still named generation 1;
//! - lockfile replay to the worktree runs under a content precondition
//!   and cannot express mutation of sealed history (there is no API
//!   that changes a generation's digest).
//!
//! ### Relationship to Protocol Lineage (`bd-l108t`)
//!
//! This module represents the local edge state machine wired into
//! [`crate::edge::cargo_resolution::seal_offline_resolution`].
//! For the shared wire-protocol model of snapshot lineage closures across
//! distributed RPC and replay verification, see
//! `rabs_protocol::snapshot_lineage::SnapshotLineage` (bead A024).
