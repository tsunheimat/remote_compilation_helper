//! Supply-chain / dependency budget gates for the RABS crates (bead A012).
//!
//! Every RABS crate carries an explicit **direct runtime dependency
//! budget**. Growth is cheap to type and expensive to own — each new
//! dependency widens the audit surface, the startup cost (fatal for tiny
//! wrappers, risk R100), and the supply-chain exposure — so exceeding a
//! budget must be a reviewed decision (bump the budget in the same change,
//! with justification), never an accident.
//!
//! Also enforced here: the license posture — every `rabs-*` crate stays
//! `publish = false` until the A016 license-metadata correction ships, so
//! no crate can be published with the workspace's currently misleading
//! plain-MIT metadata (risk R72).
//!
//! Scope note (honest boundary): these are DIRECT-dependency budgets from
//! textual manifest scans. The transitive-cone inventory (cargo-tree based,
//! per critical binary) needs CI plumbing and lands when the rabs CI job is
//! wired; until then the A002 direction gate + these budgets bound what a
//! direct edge can pull in.
