//! Cargo shim management (`rch shim install|status|uninstall`).
//!
//! rch auto-intercepts builds via the Claude Code PreToolUse hook, but that only
//! covers Claude Code. Codex, plain shells, scripts, and CI invoke `cargo`
//! directly — with no hook to catch them — so their builds run locally on the
//! box, defeating the whole point of rch on an orchestrator/dispatcher.
//!
//! rch already honors a cargo-wrapper contract: when it re-execs cargo on local
//! fallback it sets `RCH_CARGO_WRAPPER_BYPASS=1` (see [`crate::hook`]). It just
//! never shipped the wrapper, so every box hand-rolled one (or had none). This
//! command installs the ONE canonical wrapper, so every agent offloads.
//!
//! The shim is deliberately conservative:
//! - loop-safe: honors `RCH_CARGO_WRAPPER_BYPASS=1` (rch's own re-exec) → real cargo;
//! - fail-open: if `rch` is not on `PATH`, run the real cargo unchanged;
//! - IDE-safe: rust-analyzer's `--message-format=json-diagnostic-{rendered-ansi,short}`
//!   → real cargo, local. A plain `--message-format=json` (scripts, CI, lint
//!   gates) still offloads; treating every `--message-format` as an IDE was the bug
//!   that silently kept script-driven builds on the dev box;
//! - wrapper-safe: a caller-set `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` (how `cargo clippy`
//!   drives its inner `cargo check`) → real cargo, local, so the wrapper is
//!   never dropped by offloading the inner invocation;
//! - escape hatch: `RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1` forces any single build local, with
//!   the real cargo resolved in tiers (`resolve_real` in the generated body)
//!   so a renamed toolchain cargo still works;
//! - only the artifact/test subcommands are offloaded; everything else is local.
//!
//! A companion `cargo-clippy` shim catches direct invocations of that binary,
//! which never pass through `cargo` and so cannot be caught by the cargo shim.

// and agents routinely invoke `~/.rustup/toolchains/<tc>/bin/cargo` by ABSOLUTE
// path (rustup's own `cargo +nightly ...` re-exec does too), which bypasses
// PATH entirely. Wrapping the toolchain binary itself is the one layer an
// absolute-path call cannot dodge, so `shim install` does it too.
//
// Mechanism, per toolchain:
//   cargo           -> wrapper script (delegates to the canonical shim)
//   cargo-rch-real  -> the original binary, preserved by hardlinking it first
// Linking (rather than moving) the original means `cargo` never stops existing
// for even an instant, copies no bytes, and leaves the code signature intact.
// The swap-in is an atomic rename, so a concurrent exec sees either the old or
// the new file, never a missing one. (After the rename the two names no longer
// share a link count: `cargo` is the new wrapper inode and `cargo-rch-real` is
// the sole remaining name for the original inode — which is the point.)
