//! Remote Compilation Helper - PreToolUse Hook CLI
//!
//! This is the main entry point for the RCH hook that integrates with
//! Claude Code's PreToolUse hook system. It intercepts compilation commands
//! and routes them to remote workers for execution.

    # Quick start - install hook and start daemon

HOOK MODE:
    When invoked without arguments, RCH acts as a PreToolUse hook for Claude Code.
    It reads JSON from stdin, decides whether to intercept the command, and writes
    JSON to stdout. This is automatic when installed via 'rch hook install'.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    RCH_PROFILE           Profile to use: dev, prod, test (sets defaults below)
    RCH_LOG_LEVEL         Logging level: trace, debug, info, warn, error, off
    RCH_LOG_FORMAT        Log format: pretty, json, compact
    RCH_SOCKET_PATH       Path to daemon Unix socket
    RCH_DAEMON_TIMEOUT_MS Daemon socket connect/read timeout in ms, 100-600000 (default: 5000)
    RCH_SSH_SERVER_ALIVE_INTERVAL_SECS  SSH keepalive interval (ServerAliveInterval)
    RCH_SSH_CONTROL_PERSIST_SECS        SSH ControlPersist idle seconds (0 disables persistence)
    RCH_COMPRESSION_LEVEL Compression level 1-22 (default: 3)
    RCH_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS   Per-attempt source-sync timeout (default: payload-aware)
    RCH_ENV_ALLOWLIST     Comma-separated env vars to forward (e.g., RUSTFLAGS,CARGO_TARGET_DIR)
    RCH_MIN_LOCAL_TIME_MS Minimum local runtime estimate required before offload
    RCH_REMOTE_SPEEDUP_THRESHOLD Minimum predicted remote speedup ratio before offload
    RCH_VISIBILITY        Hook output visibility: none, summary, verbose
    RCH_VERBOSE           Convenience: sets visibility=verbose when true
    RCH_QUIET             Force visibility=none when true
    RCH_OUTPUT_FORMAT     Machine output format: json, toon (implies --json)
    TOON_DEFAULT_FORMAT   Default machine format when --json is set (json/toon)
    RCH_MOCK_SSH          Enable mock SSH for testing (set to 1)
    RCH_TEST_MODE         Enable test mode (set to 1)
    RCH_ENABLE_METRICS    Enable metrics collection (set to true)

CONFIG PRECEDENCE (highest to lowest):
    1. Command-line arguments
    2. Environment variables
    3. Profile defaults (RCH_PROFILE)
    4. .env / .rch.env files
    5. Project config (.rch/config.toml)
    6. User config (~/.config/rch/config.toml)
    7. Built-in defaults

USAGE:
    This command is primarily used internally by the PreToolUse hook.
    The hook intercepts compilation commands and rewrites them as:
        cargo build --release  →  rch exec -- cargo build --release

    This allows the hook to return immediately (<50ms) while the actual
    compilation runs as a normal command invocation."#)]

The Claude Code hook only covers Claude Code. Codex, plain shells, scripts, and
CI invoke `cargo` directly with no hook to catch them, so their builds compile
locally on this box. The shim sits on PATH ahead of ~/.cargo/bin and routes
offloadable cargo subcommands through `rch exec`. It is loop-safe, fails open if
rch is unavailable, and leaves rust-analyzer (`--message-format`) builds local.

Local fallbacks (RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1, wrapper bypass, IDE diagnostics) resolve
a WORKING real cargo in tiers, first executable wins:
  1. $RCH_REAL_CARGO                        explicit operator override
  2. $RCH_SHIM_REAL_CARGO                   set by the rch toolchain wrapper
  3. <active-toolchain>/bin/cargo-rch-real  active toolchain discovered via
                                           `rustc --print sysroot` (honors
                                           RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN / rust-toolchain.toml)
  4. ~/.cargo/bin/cargo                     the stock rustup proxy
Tier 3 is what saves a host whose toolchain cargo was renamed to cargo-rch-real:
the rustup proxy cannot dispatch there ("cargo component not applicable"), which
is what broke RCH_SHIM_LOCAL_IDE=1 before shim v4. A resolved cargo-rch-real
gets its bin dir prepended to PATH so the build's rustc/clippy-driver come from
the same toolchain (repo -Z flags need it). If no tier succeeds the shim exits
127 naming RCH_REAL_CARGO and `rch shim uninstall` as the fixes.

Install ONLY on dispatcher boxes (that offload OUT). NEVER on a worker box: a
worker runs cargo via rch-wkr to execute offloaded builds, and the shim would
re-offload/loop."#)]

    r#"RCH Agent Guide

Primary contract:
  RCH transparently offloads build/test commands to remote workers. If remote
  execution is unavailable or unsafe, it fails open and lets the command run
  locally.

First commands to try:
  rch --robot-triage --json       One-call quick_ref and recommended commands
  rch capabilities --json         Machine-readable command/env/exit-code map
  rch check --json                Fast readiness status
  rch status --workers --jobs --json
  rch diagnose --json "cargo test"
  rch doctor --dry-run --json

Output rules:
  stdout is data. stderr is diagnostics. Use --json for JSON and
  --format toon for TOON. Use --no-color, NO_COLOR=1, CI=true, or TERM=dumb
  when output must be plain.

Safe mutation rules:
  Use --dry-run before hook, worker, update, and fleet changes when available.
  Use --yes only when the target operation is explicit. For active builds,
  prefer graceful cancellation before --force.

Common workflows:
  Install and validate hook:
    rch hook install
    rch hook test
    rch check --json

  Explain routing:
    rch diagnose --json "cargo build --release"
    rch diagnose --json "bun test"

  Inspect fleet health:
    rch workers list --json
    rch workers probe --all --json
    rch workers capabilities --refresh --json

  Repair safely:
    rch doctor --dry-run --json
    rch config validate --json

Remediation workflows (machine-readable list under `remediation_workflows`):
  Admit before proof:
    rch admit --json "cargo test"        # offload/local/queue/defer + required caps
    RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- cargo test

  Proof mode (queued / refused / replayed):
    RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- cargo test --workspace
    # fail-closed: a refusal is RCH-I012 (never a silent local run).
    # queue/replay is daemon-driven; observe the proof_queue band in
    rch status --remediation --json

  Worker temporary bypass and auto-rejoin:
    rch workers drain <id>               # manual: stop sending new jobs
    rch workers enable <id>              # manual: bring it back
    # transient bypass + auto-rejoin are automatic; observe per-worker state in
    rch status --workers --json

  Fleet status:
    rch status --fleet --json
    rch fleet status --json

  Force resync (stale path-dependency roots):
    # convergence/resync is daemon-driven today; observe drift with
    rch doctor --reliability --scope convergence --json
    rch status --remediation --json

  Queue attach / cancel:
    rch queue --json
    rch queue --follow
    rch cancel <id>   |   rch cancel --all --yes

  Real-fleet smoke validation:
    rch self-test --all --json
    rch self-test status --json
    rch self-test history --limit 10 --json

Dashboards and metrics:
  rch dashboard                          # interactive TUI (press 'R' for remediation)
  rch web --no-open                      # fleet dashboard URL + its agent endpoint (/api/fleet?view=help)
  rchd serves Prometheus metrics (rch_remediation_* families) at its /metrics endpoint,
  and, with [api] bind set, its full /status JSON on the tailnet (see configuration guide).
