//! Central registry of schema versions across the workspace.
//!
//! Why this exists: before this module, the four schema-version constants
//! lived independently in their owning crates. They all happened to be
//! `"1.0.0"`, which masked a real bug — a comparison that should have
//! checked compatibility between two of them silently passed because the
//! values coincided. (Fixed in commit `68fcb7c`.)
//!
//! Going forward, every schema-version constant in the workspace is
//! sourced from this registry. The pinned-snapshot test in this module
//! is the gate: bumping a version requires intentionally updating the
//! snapshot table, which surfaces the change in code review.
//!
//! # Components covered
//!
//! | `SchemaComponent` variant      | Owning surface                              |
//! |--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
//! | `DoctorReliability`            | `rch doctor --reliability` JSON envelope    |
//! | `Status`                       | `rch status --json` envelope                |
//! | `RepoUpdaterContract`          | repo-updater protocol over the wire         |
//! | `ProcessTriageContract`        | process-triage protocol over the wire       |
//!
//! # Bump policy
//!
//! See bead `remote_compilation_helper-62u24.11` "Schema-version bump
//! policy + migration playbook" for the canonical procedure. In short:
//! - MAJOR: removal or rename (breaking)
//! - MINOR: new field or new enum variant (additive)
//! - PATCH: serialization-order change or doc-only change affecting
//!   golden tests
//!
//! When you bump, ALSO update `tests::test_schema_versions_match_snapshot`.
//! Reviewers see the snapshot delta and confirm the rationale.
