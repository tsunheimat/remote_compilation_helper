//! Recovery-probe + canary decision state machine for temporarily bypassed
//! workers (bd-session-history-remediation-ocv9i.1.3).
//!
//! A bypassed worker ([`crate::bypass_record::BypassRecord`]) may only rejoin
//! the fleet after it passes a recovery probe across **every** required
//! dimension for [`crate::bypass_record::AutoRejoinCriteria::required_consecutive_passes`]
//! consecutive rounds AND then passes a single canary build through the same path real
//! builds use. This module is the pure decision core of that loop:
//!
//! - [`decide_probe`] takes a worker's record + the [`RecoveryProbe`] result and
//!   returns the next [`ProbeDecision`] (stay bypassed, keep probing, ready for a
//!   canary, or — when no canary is required — rejoin), updating the record's
//!   pass/fail counters and backoff via the [`BypassRecord`] bookkeeping methods.
//! - [`decide_canary`] takes the canary [`CanaryOutcome`] and returns the final
//!   [`CanaryDecision`] (rejoin or relapse back into bypass).
//!
//! ## Cardinal safety invariant
//!
//! A worker rejoins ONLY after the required number of *fully healthy* probes
//! (every hard dimension green) followed by a passing canary — never on one
//! lucky SSH response, and never while any hard dimension is failing. A single
//! failing dimension resets the pass streak. The daemon must also never probe an
//! admin-disabled worker for auto-rejoin; that is an admin-axis decision the
//! caller enforces ([`crate::bypass_record::AutoRejoinCriteria`] lives on the
//! eligibility axis only).
//!
//! The probe *execution* (SSH/shell, exact `rch-wkr --version`, protocol
//! handshake, toolchain/target, disk+inode, load, telemetry) and the canary
//! *build* are the daemon's job; this module decides what the results mean so
//! the policy is deterministic and exhaustively testable.
